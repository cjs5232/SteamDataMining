- The UI ain't even NEAR what the pics and videos on the steam store page show.
- Graphics have apparently been toned down severely.
- FPS is shite even for high-end computers.
- Does not support SLI yet.
- Severely limited upgrading system (basically just slots for your inventory - backpack, ship and multitool)
- Crafting is a joke.
- Spaceships are all alike, only the inventory space is different. They all behave the same based on the items you have crafted. And no, there are no missile launchers, no multiple gunpoints - you can have beams and cannons, nothing more.
- No Multiplayer so far..
- HG is rumored to be going back on their word and might be making DLC's.
- Quite a few bugs, I'd suggest waiting with this game until A) The bugs are squashed and B) It's on sale.

17281347,Fallout 4,22698050,"Some key points:

Story: a little weird but fun and interesting. multiple endings. story changing consquences to some of your actions and choices.

Voice Acting: Voice acting is top notch for all characters. Brandon Keener (Garrus from Mass Effect) plays many NPCs and if you've ever played the mass effect series you'll recognize his voice right away. It's great but a little distracting when I walk across town and 5 NPCs sound like Garrus. The female player character is voiced by Courtenay Taylor who also voices a Mass Effect character. However it's not as noticable as Brandon Keener.

Visuals: (ultra settings) awesome lighting however using the console command cl_off will turn off the slight glow around all of the characters and make things a little more immersive. quality textures everyhere. explosions are great too

Customization: absolute best part of this game. Customization is an important part of games to me and this game lets you customize nearly everything: character face and hair, clothing, weapons, settlements, robots... if you can't do it in the vanilla game dont worry, there's a nexus mod for that. 

Gun play: very satisfying. weapons are loud and pack a punch. you can put bullet holes in nearly every texture. Blood spatter and watching enemies completely explode never gets old.

HUD and Pip Boy: HUD is simple and easy to use however I would prefer a mini map to that funky compass thing. but I grew up with nothing but GTA so that's why. Pip boy has everything you need (map, inventory, quests...) inventory organization could be better but again, theres a nexus mod for that.

Open World: I have over 9 days of play time and there are still locations on the map I havent been to.  I'm always finding new things. The size of interiors will surprise you too. There have been plenty of times I open a door expecting a closet or small room and end up in some giant underground bunker or vault. Some places are creepy and others are scary as $#!t. You will constantly be looking over your shoulder as you travel across the Commonwealth.

I absolutely love this game. I completed my first playthrough without any mods at all and I enjoyed every second of it. Now there are a couple DLCs and thousands of mods on NEXUSmods and it just keeps getting better. Soon the creation kit and the DLC Far Harbor will be out and I will probably double my play time.

20180900,Darkest Dungeon®,20123236,"There seems to be a fair amount of backlash regarding this game, as people like to criticize the new update for making it ""unplayable"".

That's really odd, because I find it to be a fun, enjoyable--albeit stressful--experience. If it is so unplayable, then why am I able to play it? A lot of people seem to complain about the game's difficulty and the fact that the game tends to throw a monkey wrench in your best-laid plans (a random trap attacks your Plague Doctor, enemies land a few critical blows in a row, etc.). I'd like to start out by saying, rather flatly, that this game is a roguelike, gothic, dungeon crawler. It is not Candyland.

The game does a great job of playing out the difficulties and trials associated with exploring haunted or possessed dungeons and labyrinths, infested with creatures and abominations created by your own ancestor who leaves you to clean up his grievous mess. Your team of heroes will get stressed and they may go crazy or pull through and save your team from utter ruin. This makes sense from a regular person's perspective. You're going through creepy dungeons with a bunch of strangers, armed only with the best gear a nameless heir can provide you (or is willing to), only to hope that you can survive fighting disgusting, fleshy pig creatures, skeletons, fish monsters, zombie mushroom creatures and more. How would you, as a normal person or even as a hero, not end up stressed out by this?

Of COURSE the game is supposed to be stressful and arbitrary in design to an extent--that's the point. Do you remember a roguelike game where you remember the layout of every dungeon and the item drop rates and enemy spawn rates were overly-consistent? That wouldn't be a very roguelike game if this were the case. So, if you were traversing through the halls of these places, you would be stressed out too, fighting such monsters. This would lead up to the point when you would fear for your own life from dealing with such insufferable creatures, or pull through and refuse to take this kind of treatment lying down. Sure, the game is quite spontaneous with some of the situations that occur. I once interacted with a curio incorrectly, only for my Vestal to end up with Syphillis. Needless to say, she wasn't welcomed to the Brothel any longer.

This game sets out to do what a roguelike does best: throws spontaneous game mechanics out at you while you do your best to fight them off. The object in the game is not to expect what happens next, but to survive whatever that next thing is. If your characters can't survive the onslaught, then I hope you've upgraded your Stagecoach.

tl;dr This game is great, but a lot of people complain about the difficulty, claiming it to be unfair or ""unplayable"". The game does get frustrating, but it is understandably so. It is a great purchase, especially for the $10 it is on sale for at the moment. I highly recommend it if you like gritty, dark, challenging roguelike games with turn-based elements.",1451500942,1451501026,True,6,2,0,True,True,76561198050979980,64,10,4334,0,2944

17543692,DARK SOULS™ III,26308519,"Years from now, Dark Souls III is going to be known as the ""Ocarina of Time"" of the series. Compared to the previous Souls games: artifical difficult has been replaced by unique and skillful execution, quality of life nuisances have been remedied, and sound/visuals have been improved drastically. 

In a nutshell, the biggest difference in Dark Souls III is that you aren't being tested for your patience/discipline. DS3 tests you for your skill. In DS1/2, dying was infuriating, and winning was a relief. In DS3, dying is awe-inspiring, and winning makes you feel like a lord. 

I whole-heartedly recommend you get this game. As soon as I got it, I couldn't stop playing it (I put in 68 hours over 5 weeks while working full-time and going to school). It is not flawless, but it is a clear 9/10. It's quite a enjoyable and rewarding experience.

Also, in your times of struggle, remember that every death is meant to be a lesson. The game wants you to succeed.

[b]Mechanics[/b]

Weapons are extremely unique and most of them are viable in PvE. You get to just pick whatever you want and feel like the badass that you want. Boss weapons are not impossible to come by and often feel the best. There are also many more choices for each weapon based on their ""arte"", which are more than just a guard break or a lunge forward. 

The movement/dodge system is much faster and more responsive. This would be very OP in previous Dark Souls games, but enemies in previous DS titles also were hard countered by circle-backstab anyway. The rolls in this game are appropriately needed for the changes in enemy move sets. It overall just feels better just to run around and battle.

The convenants and merchants are infinitely less cumbersome than previous. Discovering a merchant relocates them to Firelink Shrine, in which all merchants and most NPCs will stay. You won't have to go traveling for 4 minutes just to get your weapon upgraded after you buy some pyromancies anymore. Convenants are also joined by being given a Sigil following discovery. You can just swap convenants by switching this slot in your inventory instead of hunting down the convenant leader again. Also, a merchant dying no longer means that you lose their products. All in all, it is much less of a chore to do small tasks like these.

The equivalent of being human is called being Embered. Unlike in previous games, this is actually useful (you get 30% extra hp). This means that more people embered overall = more PvP interaction. Also, you gain embered status for beating a boss, which means more people want to put down their summon sign to help out others with a tough boss. Summoning also has a level limit, so you don't have to be scared of getting invaded from someone light years ahead of you in levels/gear. All of these mechanics lead to greater and more meaningful player interaction throughout your time in Lothric.

You get to warp between bonfires from the get-go, and you also don't have to upgrade specific bonfires. Some have complained that this makes the world feel a bit smaller, but I disagree. The world is extremely connected save 1 or 2 exceptions, and you can see almost every other point in the game from one another. Bonfires are also a bit more on rails, meaning that it's tough to miss one. Previously, hidden bonfires (especially in [spoiler]the Tomb of the Giants in DS1[/spoiler]) could completely change the flow of how you play the game based on whether you stumble upon it or not. There's also a generally lower amount of arbitrary shit that would punish you for lack of prior knowledge.

The weapon crafting system no longer punishes you for making a choice. You can simply swap the properties of a +10 weapon instead of having to find another one and go through the full upgrade path each time. The information about each weapon is much easier to process and there are more choices for whatever nuianced build you're trying. 

The menu overall is extremely good. You can finally navigate on a grid instead of a list, and you can tab between menus for your armor/weapons. You can have more rings and items equipped simultaneously. You can also view your status to see how many souls you need for a next level instead of stopping by a specific location. It is overall just much easier on the eyes, and it is optimized to provide convenient access to information.



[b]Combat[/b]

The bosses follow suit in the weapons improvement, and (with few exceptions) they all feel varied and deep. I've fought some bosses almost 40 times and will still see some new moves. The AI is also programmed well enough to show human tendencies like getting greedy or faking out a move. You would be able to look up a guide on these most bosses and still not find the secret to beating them. In previous DS games, it felt like you would cheese all of the bosses because they'd cheese you (just walk near them and stand behind every boss). Sometimes, you'll want to intentionally separate yourself from a boss as much as possible. Some bosses have moves to punish you positioning close; other bosses have moves to punish you for rolling as a reaction to anything. DS3 bosses have several move sets that keep it fresh several times over. I never noticed how terribly annoying previous Dark Souls bosses were (from walking to each boss to the small gimmicks and lack of tactics) until realizing how good it could be when I played DS3.

Honorable mention is that the Final Boss is an absolute beast. He is [spoiler]the summation of all who have ever Linked the Flame[/spoiler]; therefore, his fight is the deepest and most ""complete"" that I could say I remember in a video game. He's not this way because he just ""has a lot of stages"" or takes 30 minutes to beat, but because he [spoiler]contains every popular player build[/spoiler] and you will find something different each time you play him. There is also a bit of an emotional moment in which [spoiler]the music for Gwyn, the original Lord of Cinder, plays and he begins using Gwyn's sword[/spoiler]. Sometimes you feel so emotionally connected with him, that you almost don't want to win. 

The normal enemies are what you would expect, but there is fortunately a bit less mob behavior. I thought that mob behavior was a bit of a cheap excuse for difficulty, and the AI programming and enemy design has made up that difficulty in a more meaningful way in DS3. 

I unfortunately don't know too much about serious PvP, but my experience with the invasions mechanics have been pleasant when fighting another player. It hasn't really felt unfair at all, yet. 



[b]Performance & Audio/Visual[/b]

Drastic performance increase. 60 fps, unlocked resolutions (I played in 1440p). The draw distance is excellent and the environments are stunning. You will find several ""Oh my god"" moments in which you are greeted by amazing views en route to a new area. For a little bit of preview, look up the screenshots of Irithyll of the Boreal Valley. The armor and characters are also extremely sharp, and the in-game rendered cutscenes are Blizzard quality.

The audio is overhauled. The directional sound in the game rivals Counter-Strike 1.6. The materials and general pitter-pattering is very precise and varied throughout. The sounds in the game are also overall very clear; play a bit of Dark Souls 1 and you will notice a staggering difference.

The music is the best of any in the series. Several songs feel like a perfect fit for the environment/boss, instead of just sounding like generic background tunes. Pretty much any boss theme is great, but Abyss Watchers, Soul of Cinder, Pontiff Sulyvahn, Father Ariandel and Sister Friede (from the DLC), Twin Princes, and Oceiros get honorable mentions for great music. The Main Menu theme is pretty damn good, too.",1477809066,1488815299,True,2,0,0,True,False,76561198007784806,623,85,17794,0,8270

The game is very balanced in that if you are struggling with a boss or area you can generally make it easier for yourself by exploring other areas of the map and unlocking or upgrading abilities. I think the devs looked at what other games did like hollow knight or guacamelee and incorporated the things they liked in those games to Ori and the Will of the Wisps. They did it well. This game is very fun and a definite improvement on Ori and the Blind Forest.

I am currently in the final end sequence and it is kind of impossible to beat because of such a tight timer on the chase sequence and the unwieldy, borderline buggy, activation detection for one of the movement skills which i hope they are looking at fixing along with a few other minor glitches.

16779538,No Man's Sky,61207070,"Long story:

Game is still occasionally crashing and buggy.

Inventory management is bugged (e.g. container inventory is sometimes weirdly connected to ships inventory and you're unable to get items out of it if there's broken tech on the same place), the inventories themselves are a hell to manage across freighter containers and bases. 

Multiplayer groups are often auto disbanded with no reason, friends are not always teleported to your system when connecting.

Quests are often bugged and require game restart or leaving and returning to the location.

It's a good idea, it's nice to explore the worlds (until you realize that they're almost all the same...), but I just expected more from a game that has three years after release and still shows off lots of ""big"" updates. (The last update being music boxes!? Really? There's lots of bugs still from the initial release and you're working on music boxes...)

TL;DR

Repetitive gameplay, still occasionally crashing and buggy.

Points to improve:

There are lots of options to handle situations. Unfortunately you will only use a few of these possibilities and ignore the rest. Also the encounter with guards is in my opinion too fast and deletes in this moment the tactical aspect of the game. The timer after firing your gun does not fit in.

5799074,Stardew Valley,34074637,"Cons:
I got very frustrated when I first purchased the game due to lack of instructions for basic things such as how to place/rotate furniture or remove them. When you play this game, google is a must LOL. Came to find out the game was developed by 1 person. I retracted my original harsh review. I still believe basic instructions should be a part of game and not something a player have to Google for however, I know how much work it's involved in making a game and after 40+hrs gameplay on XBOX ONE I realize the dev has put effort on other things that deserved to be praised.

Tips for new PC player thinking about getting this game, do NOT play with touchpad/gamepad. Otherwise, get ready to be frustrated. After my initial frustration I did some research and found out there was a bug with the touchpad/gamepad that cause delay for ""action"" button. Also many said console controller works. I can confirm this for XBOX ONE controller.

Pros:
This game is better than old Harvest Moon game I used to played 10+ years ago. There is so many things you can do from farming, foraging, fishing, mining, fighting monsters, taking quests etc (I personally like being able to make artisan goods). The game is LGBT inclusive which is a nice touch. I personally didn't encounter bug in this game other than the whole gamepad/touchpad thing on PC. Though on XBOX ONE, I found one part of  Sebastian Heart Events (unimportant to the story) where i cannot choose the second choice for the ""game"". Game gave me weird static noise and didn't highlight second choice. I got a D for the evaluation cuz I can't choose the second choice so by default my answer is the first choice. 

Overall Pros outweight Cons. I highly recommend this game if you like Harvest Moon/farming simulation mixed with extra stuff.

I really like the fact that bios can be added to the characters, it's surprisng how something so simple can add so much depth to the game. 

Many of the enemies we all know and loved from XCOM2's predecessor make repeat appearances along with some new and frightening foes that keep players on their toes. The classes also recieved an overhaul with a few new ones to compliment the roster. Enemy toughness is balanced with the abilities the classes have. Some abilities may feel overpowered but no one class can dominate the battlefield (like the sniper with ""In The Zone"" in Enemy Unknown). 

A new and very interesting mechanic in this game is the ""concealed"" stage in the beginning of some missions. This allows you to recon the map and choose when to engage the enemy and also set up deadly overwatch ambushes. I really like this mechanic and think it's an excellent addition to the game.

The story seems totally worthless (you are the chosen one!!!!!!, also, please break out of jail!), characters seem boring, and encumbrance is a terrible gameplay element in any game. Obvious UI changes added by fan-made mods were totally missed by the developers when they made the game, perhaps for simplicity's sake. I play with a controller, so most of the SkyUI mod's keyboard-friendly changes don't help me, but some of it is still far better than the base game.

Some of the cool mods require at least one piece of paid DLC, which brings the on-sale price of Skyrim up to $13.59 (the cheapest way to get the game + DLC). That's more than it costs to buy any number of incredible games. $7.49 would be more appropriate. It's amazing to me that Skyrim still sells well at these rip-off prices, because I just don't see what makes it fun.

One of the most vital mods, Skyrim Script Extender, doesn't integrate well with the main game and needs to be launched from a separate file. Proper mod support for an epic, sprawling game like this would have been nice.

I'll take a turn-based Japanese RPG like Paper Mario, Earthbound, or even Pokemon over an action-focused Western RPG like this or Fallout 3.

I would consider myself respectful of all creatures, but was still intrigued by the thought of hunting and killing an animal for food.
As gaming is a way of experiencing alternate realities, and the game was on sale, I thought I would give it a go... But I wouldn't tell anyone...
I was expecting that the attitude of the game would be perhaps more macho than I would like, but shamefully continued with the purchase.
And now, here I am writing a review!
I live in South Africa, so the bushveld lifestyle is part of our culture, and these guys have completely captured the experience of being on safari.
The sense of realism is visceral, and as someone who has never actually hunted, I feel the game has been insightful too.
But more than anything else - it's called ""The Hunter"", but that is just a tiny part of what they have done.
And that is a major achievement for any developer - to make a game that people can adapt to their own imaginations.
If you're in to hunting I would say it's a must have.

I love the realism and sometimes the unexpected happens and if you're like me, you get extremely excited because of the little things like relationships with people and how people treat you differently because of things you've done or neglected to do. The game does require some thinking which includes things such as realizing if something is time sensitive(They don't tell you the due date most of the time) and sometimes it doesn't always tell you exactly what to do or what you're searching for, but I love it. Although I love the game and I know this is the first in the series and hopefully not the last, I would like to provide some constructive criticism:

Firstly the game has some game breaking bugs, like at some points the game goes into an infinite loading state where you have to download a cheat mod from https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance/mods/106 and then use '`' to enter console and type 'cheat_save' to save in that moment and then you have to close the game and I had to close steam also, and then you load back into the game to get past it. Also if you're concerned about mods disabling achievements, it doesn't. I used it and still got my achievements after that. I believe this mod or perhaps another also helps with finding an NPC if you can't find him/her. But personally I didn't have the problem.

The game is also very graphics consuming and I understand that the game is quite large and I don't understand how the world spawns in entities or how they work or whatever, but I am running a gtx1080 and I ran with settings between very high and ultra high (simply because I love graphics), but it also cost me LOT of frames. In scenes where there were a bunch of people fighting, my frames dropped to about 15fps, so be warned.

Other than that I absolutely love the game and I've prescribed it to most of my friends who I know would enjoy the genre. I can't wait for the sequel.

I could only recommend on the basis that you ignore 99% of the fucking abysmal fanfiction-level story/plot/characters and skip every cutscene, and 20% of the game mechanics. If I had paid full price for this game I would feel cheated.

I find the endgame much more fun than the main game as I get cooler abilities and prestige skills let me get rather op, without being constantly reminded of the terrible story

The game is hugely repetitive and if you don't enjoy killing orcs and jumping around a lot you won't enjoy the game

Nemesis system is alright. Makes for fun situations but is bloated with annoying features like 'no chance' and a seemingly 50% chance that any enemy killed comes back to ambush you later, and if you fight more than one captain at once go make a cup of tea because they'll still be performing their monologues when you get back - also captains are either totally unable to speak or ridiculously eloquent with no in-between

Core mechanics from the first game are what makes this game fun to play. 

Despite the fun mechanics and many hours I have played it is very hard for me to press the recommend button when I know that they made Isildur and Helm Hammerhand ringwraiths, made Celebrimbor (just an elf good at making rings) more powerful than Sauron, made Sauron just some evil elf dude who can change shape, made Shelob a 'sexy' romantic interest for Sauron who 'takes the form of a spider' literally just because of a metaphor about fate being a web... I could go on for a very long time. 

They took the greatest lore in existence and tore all meaning from it... but worse still they then used the tattered remains in an extremely bland, uninteresting, predictable storyline with nothing to offer. This game has honestly got the worst story of any game I have ever played. Chess has a better story than this. This makes splosion man look worthy of a nobel prize for literature.

I realise nobody actually cares what I think but here we are. As much as I started writing this having ticked the 'yes' button, I must now change it to a 'no'. This is because I asked myself: ""Would I recommend this game to a friend?"". No. No I would not. I have friends who've played and enjoyed it, and as much as I've had some fun playing it, I honestly would not recommend this game to a friend. If you find yourself buying it, you will probably have fun, but if you want a good LOTR game RUN IN THE OTHER FUCKING DIRECTION

19658919,Deep Rock Galactic,40646205,"I understand that this game is still in early access, and when the game fully releases and if it seems a lot better to me I'll come back and play it again and edit this review. As of right now however I would not recomend this game to anyone unless you have a group of at least three other friends who would be down for playing this game as a group. I've seen it addressed in some other non positive reviews but the ""quickplay"" feature is awful. It gives the host the ability to kick anyone they want, and when you're a solo player ready to dive into a mine and start spelunking, getting kicked from multiple parties, even the same one mulitiple times, is an awful way to spend an hour. Perhaps simply changing the quickplay feature to just that a quickplay feature, when playing Overwatch I can't kick someone on my team, so why here? For people with a team let them do invite or private groups.

Besides that the actual gameplay itself was a bit lack luster. Sure you'll spend some time mowing down waves of spider like creatures during a ""horde"" section. And even some time traversing the underground caves mining and recieving minerals, etc. But I found the majority of the time I spent in caves was spent back tracking where I had just been, or where my teammates had been. There is a map in the game, but it's bound to the ""M"" button I believe and requires you to hold it down to activate (and while you want to use it)... That is just plainly bad game design. You litterally have to remove you right hand from your mouse, or strech your index finger so far that your normal ""WASD"" position is thrown off horrendiously. also the map itself is poor and confusing, and in a game where you are constantly changing elevation players would be much better off with a 3d map, along the lines of the one in Subnatica, that displays the area around you in a 3d image, this would better help the player understand where they could possibly go. Back to the back tracking, but not off of navigation, the game itself is very dark, of course it would be I mean you're spelunking there is no sun down there. And you are given 3 flares that recharge but don't provide a long amount of light, their is also a class that offers a flare gun. Said flare gun can be upgraded in a few ways one of which I believe was allowing the flares to last longer, as I'm sure their is probably one for your common flares too. The problem is the flares don't last long enough and even when you think you've found a new tunnel to explore, many times you'll soon come to find a handful of burnt out flares littering the floor, left by one of your teammates, or even you. 

I feel like I could go on for a while, but I in know way mean any disrespect to the developers of this game. Obviously the game itself peaked my interest enough to purchase it (even though I later returned it), and the game itself runs well, the concept is fun, and the writing and voice acting warranted a few chuckles. I just don't think the game is all there yet ( It's early access I know). But from the other early access games I've played I was just expecting more. Of course I'm sure they'll add some sort of a ""campaign"" to the game, and maybe even scale down the single player difficultly too, as when I tried that I kept getting destroyed by the ""Horde"" sections, it almost seems they didn't change anything between single and team mode besides you getting a robot companion to help out.

If a dev does read this though, good job on what you've done! When your game fully releases and it seems more player freindly I may shell out a more expensive fee to give it a whirl again and then happily change this review! 

Just please take these notes into consideration:
- Rework the map - I'd say make it 3d and stick it in the character's U.I. so it's not clunky for the players to view and use it
- Seperate private and quickplay lobbies - If someone has 3 friends that want to play a game together great! But let the loners group up together without getting kicked from game after game.
- A slight rework on the flares, at the least scouts flare guns flares should be upgradeable to never run out (this may be a later upgrade already that I just never reached). And if you're worried about scouts spamming flares and supply drops to light up the whole tunnel system, cap the amount of active flares each scout can have. Say 10 perma flares be scout, unless you think having a possible 40 never dying flares up at a time is too much.",1520485725,1520485725,False,2,1,1,True,True,76561198041941906,278,3,152,0,152

There are a few QOL changes I don't particularly a fan of (some of which makes it easier for new players to enjoy the game), but for the most part they are welcomed.  Combat feels meaty and satisfying, definitely an improvement over previous titles. The addition of Turf Wars is also something I've always dreamed of seeing since the first MH. The only thing missing is an actual endgame, which I hope the devs fix that in future updates (add G-RANK!). Another thing I would like to see added in the future is more monsters.

I just got the game. Really takes me back to the days of Sim City 4, I really loved that game. Both my father and I are not disappointed in this one, either. It's pretty addicting, works in a lot of the same ways, and has a lot of the same challenges and abilities. Aside from a few complaints, I definitely recommend this game for someone who has a lot of down time.

[u]Pros:[/u]
-Very user friendly. Not hard to learn
-Water body physics(really loved that one)
-Decent graphics
-Few to no bugs
-Allows you to get very creative with your city designs
-Tutorial is very straightforward
-Building is often not complex
-Progression is mostly easy
-Zoning allows for easy organization of sectors in your city
-Nostalgic
-Easy terrain manipulation(besides the soil limit)

[u]Cons:[/u]
-No first person camera
-Passive notification system ""Chirp"" is very, very annoying without a silencer mod; seldom offers relevant information in the later stages of city building
-Leaves you to Google every time sh*t randomly hits the fan(luckily, because this happens so often, fixes are usually easy to find)
-No natural disasters without the paid DLC. Pretty disappointing to be honest
-Features that serve no purpose(i.e. ChirpX rocket facility)
-Monuments/Unique buildings that require odd/outrageous feats/requirements(i.e. Court House required for Medical Center, 20 weeks of ≤ 4% tax income rates for a Posh Mall) -- pretty much requires you to destroy your hard work to get trophies

Overall, [i]fantastic[/i] game. Mainly disappointing to people who aren't new to these kinds of games(like myself), but it's hard to get away from. Always seems to be something new to add to your cities. And in the end, they always look great(especially at night).",1546301919,1546302021,True,13,0,0,True,False,76561198108430745,60,4,1807,0,977

Terraria is overall a game you would spend hours playing it, also the multiplier is insanely fun, allowing friends to play in a hunger games format, snowball fights, hell to attempting hard-mode with no real success!

I mean, where do I even begin? The amount of emotion conveyed through the characters' interactions is intense. It gets to the point where even listening to the OST (which is amazing, btw) hits me with some of the feels. The gameplay is simple enough, where the only ""challenge"" consists of knowing or figuring out which drinks to make at what times. It really fits the bill of being a real bartender, remembering who likes what when they're in a particular mood, or the ""usuals"" for your regulars. I'd say it's more of a visual novel than a ""game"", but the extra endings with NG+ and 100% achievement runs push it away from that (especially a certain minigame). The setting and development of the game's main plot is also very well done, with all the little things characters say about their dystopian cyberpunk world adding to the development of setting and theme. There's a lot to be said about each character, but for the sake of keeping a concise review and hiding spoilers, I highly advise anyone planning on playing this masterpiece to find out as much as they can about someone before judging them as there's a lot more to each character than what you're first introduced to. Everything can be accomplished in just a few runs, so huge amounts of commitment aren't required. It's more or less one of those games you buy, play a ton and really enjoy, completely finish, then look back on with fond memories. While you won't get more than 30 hours doing everything, those will be some of the best 30 hours of your life.

5432407,DOOM Eternal,66034531,"Doom Eternal is a sequel to Doom 2016 which often feels like another restart of Doom series.
1. Gameplay
Gameplay is most changed part of Doom Eternal vs Doom 2016
Combat is fast, complex and deep. Amount of different mechanics is staggering: regular weapons, super weapons, crucible, weapon mods, glory kills, blood punch, frag and ice grenades, flamethrower, chainsaw,
double jump, dash, powerups, enemy weak spots.
Combat is fun in general and challenging, but sometimes feels suffocating and much more restrictive than Doom 2016.
You see Cacodemon - ready you grenade, Archnotron, Revenant, or Mancubus - shoot the guns, no ammo(this happens too often to be fun) - search for enemy to chainsaw it, no armor - burn enemy to get some.
This often feels like routine, thing you need to get out of your way to return to the fun.
There is also duelist type of enemy - Marauder. Battling him reminds me of Sekiro or Dark Souls - you keep optimal distance, wait for an attack and parry.
He is fun to battle one-on-one, but on arenas with other monsters he kinda break the flow and more irritating that challenging.
Powerup are very rare in Doom Eternal(Berserk encountered one time), which I do not like as they were so much fun in 2016.

Also there is much more parkour. It's out-of-place stylistically and destroys atmosphere(especially Bowser castle like rotating flame tubes), but gameplay wise I found it pretty fun actually. 

2. Levels and monsters design.
More varied levels locations, more different monsters. Some levels are great(like Super Gore Nest or Urdak), others are pretty forgettable(Cultist Base, Sentinel world). Sentinel world and Urdak feel like they belong to a different game(Urdak is something out of Destiny).
Hub - Fortress of Doom feel empty and unnecessary.
Monsters sometimes look cartoon-like or like they are from Quake 2. In general Doom 2016 design is more consistent.

3. Story.
Doom 2016 story was simple and never took itself too serious. Doom Eternal tries to be real story game, but story is full of cliché, generic and bland.
Do not expect much.

4. Graphics and performance.
Not a significant improvement over Doom 2016, but looks great. Performance is worse on weak PCs though.

5. Music.
Music is written by Mick Gordon similar to Doom 2016.
It's really good, but some tracks have annoying high frequency chipping sounds(like Mars core).

Verdict: 8/10, buy even without discount
Doom Eternal is great FPS and feels fresh and different from Doom 2016. So different that it does not feel like Doom sometimes.
I enjoyed it, but Doom 2016 is much more style and raw fun in my opinion. But if you like FPS, play both games, both are fun.",1585424331,1585424331,True,0,0,0,False,False,76561198260391424,121,24,1712,0,1712

It tells a beautiful story of family and the bumps along the way to reconciliation and reunion.

There's no one RIGHT WAY to play ""Hades"". Every play style is encouraged, and you can take it at your own pace whether you're just grinding certain things OR trying to get your way to end of each run to learn more.

There is so much to love about this game from the monsters and magic to the detail put into every soldier. Some things could be fixed in relation to balancing with different unit types and the AI but really those are nitpicky things. There are only three things that make me pull out my hair.

1) You can't conquer every settlement. If you are the dwarfs you can't obliderate the vampires and turn their stomping grounds into forified cities. IF you are the Vampires you can't turn those lovly dwarven halls into dens of undeath. Why the hell would vampires not love the mountains!!!! idiotic! Keeping the chaos wastes seperate makes sense with the game but not to the extent they did seperating by terrain types. 

2) Why in the hell did they decide that there were so few building types...come on. seriously. Plus the lack of building towns into cities that can go up to level 5 seems like a weird choice. 

3) Fix the weird chaos dynamic. I realize that world events can cause chaos but the entire world? one time playing the orcs i had moved my troops up to attack the dwarves and all of a sudden two choas units spawned at the very corner of the orc desert area. Why in the hell would chaos give a flying crap about a corner like that and why did they spawn there when chaos is supposed to be seeping from the north. Something should be done about balancing it better.

This isn't your sister's Minecraft Server Boy! This is Rust! Either the new verison or Legacy you'll fight off the naked hordes out to kill you for what ever you may have, weather it be for your Rock or your Blot-action Rifle you just made you can bet they are coming for you! The island is large, the naked ones are every where and you, you have to live to see tomorrow. Build a base, built it quick get your mats and make your gun and get ready to defend yourself!

I've played both the New Version and Legacy and logged 200+ hours since I bought the game over a year ago. It's been fun, it's driven me mad and it's been laughable! I think Rust is best played with a friend or five and raiding and larger, long fire fights are a MUST! IF you have bought or are thinking about buying the game remember this: It's in Alpha and does come with some bugs, just report them the best you can and sometime soon (or rather sooner or later) Gary and his team will fix it.

You can build structures, collect resources and eat people. The most frequent thing you will encounter in the game are Cannibals. Their behavior changes how you interact with them. Some groups are highly aggressive. Others are happy to watch you from a distance. These behaviors give them an extremely creepy vibe. You never know if one may be watching you from a distance. Are those your footfalls through the forest underbrush? an animal? or something stalking you.

The story is conveyed in a similar way to Subnautica or Dark Souls in my opinion. You find bits and pieces throughout the world as you explore that let you fill in the story as you go. I found it pretty fun to speculate with friends on what we thought.

The survival aspects of the game arent too hamfisted. Its reasonable to satisfy your hunger and thirst. The hardest part for me was maintaining a supply of medicine as the enemies do hit quite hard and can combo you out in 4-5 hits if you get unlucky.

The worst part of the game for me in my opinion was the inventory system. It was cool and thematic but I found it to be really clunky to use. It felt like it was built for a controller and then sloppily ported over to pc. If you didnt hotkey things and needed something like an explosive in the middle of a fight, good luck trying to pull it out or make it.

19761982,Hunt: Showdown,40317617,"Until the server issues have been fixed/adressed, I wouldn't recomend buying it. Right now, Day one, The duo queues are down. Apparently this was an issue in the alpha and was never fixed. Let me put this in perspective: They release the game into Early Access, To the public. Then the devs go to sleep. That's it. Open the game to the masses, And just leave it. How could I know you might ask? Because their Discord is being blown up with the server issues, And the Discord admins can't even reach the team. I'm not sure how it's acceptable, Even with an early access. It's like Conan Exiles all over. The ""It's EA, What did you expect?"" excuse doesn't apply. Like not one person could be paid overtime to sit and maintain the servers on the day they show the game to the world. If that doesn't spell trouble for the game I'm not sure what does. 

That coupled with the games absolutely terrible performance is a tough sell. Cryengine once again proves it can't run decently. For now anyway. My 980ti, i7 4790k, And on an SSD struggle to hit the 50 FPS mark, Dipping as low as 20 FPS at times. 

With all that said, The game itself is a lot of fun. If it ran good, and had servers that functioned, It would be a solid purchase. But as of right now, It's actually unplayable.

Day Two: The servers remain unstable, But at least they are aware and are resetting them when they drop within an hour or so.

Day Three: They've placed a temporary cap on the number of players that can play on the servers at once to keep them up. It didn't help. They're still dropping.

Edit 2/27/2018:New news from EA launch day. Apparently the team wasn't asleep. They were having an EA launch party, While the servers were down all day launch day. LOOK AT ALL THE CASH WE MADE! $$$.

Anyways, I do believe this beats Hatoful Boyfriend in plot whiplash for me - I hadn't even been aware that was a category I had. Somehow, in an unbelievable turn of events, this game brought me to tears twice - once when Sayori confesses, and once when I did what I did to Monika at the end. As a person who doesn't cry often (not since last year, probably) I aupplaud Team Salvato.

If there are any people who read through some reviews, like I did/do, try to refrain from reading spoilers if you can. Especially the longer ones... This game is better going in not knowing what to expect and what's going to happen. The plot twist is better experienced by yourself, which, I suppose is a spoiler in itself, but trust me on that.
Uh, for seizure prone people, do be wary, as there are some flashes of sorts -- really short glimpses but something that might be of note to you.

Now, I'm not sure if it's my game specifically or if they simply don't write anything down on their poems, but the poems they give me during the club are blank and reviews and online information seems to imply that they aren't supposed to be? Fortunately, how the characters discuss the poems give me enough of an idea, so there's that as well.

The characters are well rounded (well...) and I do reserve a special place for Monika in my heart [spoiler]Just Monika. Always Monika.[/spoiler] and the plotline is wonderful. Although I'm not sure if I can bring myself to play it again (at least, not anytime soon) after what I experienced.

6428586,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,48197112,"The game started off well, had the potential to be legendary but over the years it's lost its flame. unfortunately, this game is in its own sub-genre, it has no direct competition, leaving the game to stay the same and still be useful, there are still bugs that are years old, no innovation or real effort from the developers is ever given, it has taken literal years for basic features to be implemented and there are still many missing that should've been there on day 1. its a shame to see such a great concept in the hands of Ubisoft, they know they don't have to do anything so they don't. 

the best thing that has ever happened to this game is outbreak, which was just an alpha for another title 

the competitive scene is in shambles, Ubi doesn't care about the health of its player base or the game itself, they would rather add broken operators to increase SP sales than they would listen to the pro community,

the cheaters, don't even get me started: I have been lucky enough to only meet a handful in my time on PC, but this is what's going to kill the game, not the braindead devs. there were fewer cheaters back in y1 before the game even had an anti-cheat

the power creep of DLC operators. they went from some really basic stuff like an underbarrel shotgun to operators that give you wallhacks if your enemies move. these global operators have taken all the a from the game and turn it into a glorified deathmatch. 

you don't need teamwork anymore, you don't need to communicate or use your brain to win anymore. it's just a game of who is the better ape.

it's honestly sad to see how this game is slowly killing itself while it still has potential to be legendary, it used to be thought of as a csgo rival with its tactical gameplay, now it is an overwatch rival... and overwatch is the better game.

At first, when changing from vanilla BoI to Rebirth it's a bit of a shock.
The oversized rooms made me a bit motion sick for the first few runs, but I came to hate them(for sheer difficulties' sake) just as much as I hate D10. 

That being said, Rebirth is one of the best games I have played. BoI is always a great game in my eyes, and if it could be ANY better than it is, Rebirth would be that better version. 

With so much content and replay value, it's very challenging not to binge play this game until early dawn. The new characters are a neat addition, (RIP lucky foot Cain, the first character I beat mom with. So sad to see you go....) like 
Spolier for example.

Then i decided no because the retail of this game is 60$ and i got it for 8$ and doom retail is 20$ and it costs 10$ right now. I think this game is amazing and offers some nice replayability and the A.I has made a nice improvment since Sniper Elite 3. The X-Ray never gets old and the cinematic setups when you kill someone (9/10 of the times) is amazing. I can't call this game much more than amazing but there is always the but! This game doesn't have any huge story you are just this guy sent into the field to kill targets in italy of WW2 so if you are more into story than gameplay i'am sorry because this game has more good gameplay than story. The second con is that most of the weapons are DLC and there are DLC maps. I personally don't think season pass or DLC is worth it. The guns aren't the primary aspect of this game and if you want new weapons you can pick up new ones on the maps in the game. For maps you don't need DLC ones because the 8 campaign missions there is are more open world than previous games. The game has decent multiplayer but it isn't something i'd play instead of my other games but its still playable.

My final score for this game is a solid 8/10. The game is amazing and has incredibly fun gameplay with a mechanic that never gets old, X-Ray. What doesn't give it 10/10 is the playable multiplayer which could be better and that a huge amount of maps and weapons are DLC.

4853986,Kenshi,79712575,"Kenshi in my opinion is a very solid game in the RPG genre in fact id almost argue one of the few open world RPGs that I personally would play. That being said in my opinion Kenshi is a bit fickle depending on who you ask but i think we can all agree its open endedness allows any way to play the game. You can play it like a gamey RPG and build up your stats, you can play it and role play certain scenarios, you can chuck in some mods for an essence unique flavor and potential RNG. Heck you can go so far as add completely new scenarios that are not present in the base game or play with the myriad of scenarios in the base game. I play my RPGs usually on the stat grindy gamey kind of way and I know I am gonna get some slack for it from some. That being the people saying that is not the way Kenshi is suppose to be played but the fact that you can go any way you want is a winning point of the game.

In any case is Kenshi perfect No... there is three glareing problems with it and its nothing to do with the gameplay itself I think that part is refined to perfection its mainly world randomization and how the game loads and runs.
 
My first problem is the lack of randomness to the world many things are set in stone and I am fine with random elements thrown into a preset world but the entire world layout is preset. Clearly this game was designed with the kind of mindset of a non objective kind of person basically someone who makes there own goals. The problem with the preset world is because quite a few things are pre set you can essentially cheese the games progression if you know the layout of the map and all its secrets. And it leaves less for returning players as there is random elements but there not applied to the lay of the land. which can be positive and negative depending on who you are.

Secondly and I think we can all agree on this, the sim speed options needs some serious work done to it 3x (the max speed) is just not enough...take it from me, 76 hours at the time of writing and it took a LONG time to build up my characters and my labor stat a common stat for many things is not 100 yet (100 being a stats maximum without mods) on any character despite the labor intensity I put them through...Like seriously 6x and I bet you I would be as far as I am 40 hours in just a simple addition can save so much time...I know there is a mod that can do that but it needs to be a thing for the base game.

And finally the loading, any veteran kenshi player will tell you when your characters builds up there movement enough it will be so fast it will out speed the game engines ability to loading area, same with switching between characters far away. This needs to be worked on to be sped up and not only sped up but render MORE area then what the max allows cause the area takes a long time to load and you have to do it like every 10 seconds with certain character set ups. I am a veteran gamer who played PS2 era games with loading times in the half a minutes range but I can tell you most modern gamers will rant about it.

But the Gameplay and the complexity to mechanics are amazing like the Gameplay and its depth are very nice satisfying especially to those who like deep mechanic RPGs. The whole gimmick of the game makes it so your character builds up from basically doing anything including getting there S*** kicked in, yes your characters durability grows by getting his S*** kicked in, what game rewards the player for that? The only time you are really at risk of dying is when you only have 1 guy and you get badly beaten up and you can save and reload at any time to fix any mistakes that involve that.

Anyways here is some tips for the beginner, always put food in a bag and stick the bag in your inventory, if your getting looted nothing in your bag will ever be taken that way when someone loots you after knocking you out. (you can choose to not do this if you think it is illegitimate.) And if your mining to make money then it is in your best interest to buy a construction component or 2 and plant some torches near your mining site to combat darkness and that applies to anything around labor, period as darkness applies a penalty to anything labor related so by wearing a lantern or by putting torches up near where your working/mineing (make sure your character is in the light to benefit from the lights effect) which cost one construction component and can be placed mostly anywhere regardless of location. You can cancel the penalty of working in the dark and work to your maximum ability no matter the time of day.

And finally play the game how you like to play it, there is no right way to play Kenshi its all in personal preference and the game as I said allows full freedom on any route or way you wish to play and your character develops from your actions, trials and work they endure. So by the end its all your decision, and with that in mind my rating for the game is a 8.5 out of 10 a very solid deep RPG with its only problems being engine side which we are hoping Kenshi 2 or a patch to Kenshi 1 that can iron out these issues whilst keeping the depth that make this game so good.",1606144966,1606145130,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198042231954,185,10,5600,0,4551

But Got the Credits with the Sprit in my Hands & my mouth left Wide open.
to No Zen.
if you never played it its alright but to those who have it felt as if they left out a big part of the game.

Online is fantastic i may Say, 
I even got to play with a Dev & had a Chat about the game thanking him , 
it was Wonderfull & i also found a little easter egg on a Pc in the game , with a Note from a Dev to another Dev.

3692838,Hollow Knight,54510637,"Hollow Knight is a masterpiece. The art style is stunning, the music is immersive, and the game play is satisfying and predictable, but still flexible. I went into the game with high expectations. I felt myself getting bored and frustrated around the time I got to the city of tears because I could not figure out for the life of me how to beat the soul master (it took me three hours to finally beat him), but afterwards, the game went relatively smoothly. That's really the only complaint I have about this game.

Hollow Knight is NOT a game for beginners. You do have to have a decent reaction time to play this game. But it is not impossible to learn how to manage the game play. I wish that someone would have told me just how frustrated I was going to feel over the course of this game, and I wish that someone would have told me a few things before starting this game. So, here are some things I recommend doing to make Hollow Knight slightly easier:

    1.  Get a controller, or change the default keyboard settings. You will be pressing more that just two or three buttons at once by the end of the game. You need to be able to move your character around, swing your nail, heal, and use spells without having to think at all about doing so.

    2. Buy all of the upgrades. By the end of this game, you will have a TON of geo from just wandering around and absolutely nothing to spend it on because you will have bought everything (besides the unbreakable charms, those do actually require farming geo). Also, throw money into the wishing well thing. You'll see when you get to that part of the game.

    3. When you're doing the Gray Mourner flower quest, go VERY slowly. The fog canyon is a great route because nothing is actively trying to attack you and the only thing that can mess you up is you. There's no point in jumping around carelessly because you'll just have to start over anyway. I managed to do it first try by looking up the easiest way, setting a dream gate at the Gray Mourner's house, and slowly inching towards my destination. Do not take any risks. This is the hardest mask shard in the game.

    4. If you get mad- and you will get very, very, VERY mad- take a break. The best thing for a boss fight you can't beat is to sleep on it. Your subconscious will practice it overnight and you'll wake up the next day being better at it than you were before. I thought the FINAL final boss of Hollow Knight was impossible, but I slept on it and beat it second try the next day. It's science. And it keeps this game from giving you a heart attack.

    5. To get out of the Beast's den, go left and stay as far left as you can while going down until you get to the bench room. There's a piece of breakable floor in that room which will allow you to get out of there. I spent far too much time in that maze and I'm sure other people have made the same mistake.

    6. If you're going to speed run the game to get the achievement or you're attempting steel soul, you NEEEEEEED to master the watcher knights. I can not stress how important this is. Yes, it will take you upwards of six hours to do this. But it will make your life so much easier if you can beat them first try with only five masks. You can practice by going to the Hall of Gods in Godhome and unequiping all charms. Try to beat them without using shadow dash. You'll know you're ready when you can get through to whole fight reliably without healing.

    7. For the entire game: have patience. You will want to cry and scream and tear you're hair out, but you'll get there. Everyone starts off not even being able to beat Hornet 1 without dying over and over and over, but when you come back after having played through the whole game, the early stages will feel like a joke. Whenever you're feeling down, just say to yourself, ""At least it's not the path of pain."" Unless it is.

What you need:
- interest in tactical shooter games
- maybe few friends
- capable of learning
- have patience
- communicate with teammates
- standard pc

Pro:
+ attack & defend system
+ lot of Maps
+ lot of guns
+ much operators with different skills
+ much skins for weapons and operators
+ regular updates (seasons) with cool stuff (new operator)
+ big community
+ No pay to win
+ great graphic-performance 
+ rare skins (""Blackice"")
+ current since 2015 <3

Contra:
- sometimes laggy servers
- cheater problem
- hitbox problems
- toxic community
- rage potential (like in any other game lol)
- no singleplayer/ story mode :,(

summary:
- if you have friends = better chances for wins
- if you have aim = no problem
- if you love shooter = good game
- toxic communities everywhere
- you have always teammates who sucks
- anti cheat (battle eye) is very bad at the moment
- head hitboxes are sometimes buggy
- much fun potential
- more fun potential with friends

Risks and Side Effects:
- sometimes you feel slight aggression
-> better take a break xD

P.S.: dont destroy your setup, that `s not worth it

I don't care if this is an overstatement but this is probably my favorite Half Life game of the series. I was on my toes in some parts, sweating in others, and staring in his amazement of seeing a fascinating universe up close and in your face. I can't even imagine what the game is like on the Index but on my Rift S, it was gorgeous. Looked exactly like real life. The action was awesome, crouching behind cars and shooting like I was in an action movie. I think the only small problems I had was the loading screens (which I'm assuming vary) were quite long for me. The other issue was switching between weapons was a little wonky at times but it is what it is. The biggest problem was that it wasn't long enough. Phenomenal.

16623833,ARK: Survival Evolved,29962035,"I give a thumbs down because of the developer issues. This is a fun game that I enjoyed up to a point when I decided to quit. If you want to keep playing and spend additional time breeding and building by all means feel free. Where I really take issue is with developers putting out paid expansions on an unfinished game that I paid to back. Also lag is completely game breaking if there are more than 15-20 people on a server. Updates are never on time and bugs don’t seem to ever get addressed. Hackers are not banned or penalized when caught. You can’t turn off chat and there are trolls constantly baiting people. 

I really liked the beginning of this game. When you start off it is fun to explore and build up your base/character. My brother and I were relatively successful with just two people on a PVE server. As you progress it becomes exceedingly difficult to level up without spending literally hundreds of hours trudging through and near impossible to gather enough resources to do any of the cool stuff without working with a few other players. 

There’s two ways to play
PVP involves joining the biggest gang on the server so as not to get slaughtered every 10 seconds by jerks. Basically it sucks, read the other hundreds of reviews about it.

PVE
No one can hurt you so you can build up a nice creative base and tame a bunch of dinos. This is what I did. I played for 450 hours total and basically stopped because to go any further in the game would require me to dedicate my life to it.

Beginning Game (0-200 hours)
A lot of fun, you spend time building small bases, exploring, getting eaten, hunting, etc.

Middle Game (200-500 hours)
Takes a lot of time to gather materials to do anything cool like building giant castles or taming bigger better dinos. You need help to do this. You cannot leave the game for more than 2 to 3 days because your dinos will starve to death while you live your real life.

Middle Game (500-1000 hours)
There were people on my server putting in 60+ hours a week to raise and breed dinos. Seriously life sucking game at this point and there’s no way around it. Breeding literally takes days with more supervision than a real life human baby, I’m not exaggerating. 

End Game (1000+ hours)
It really isn’t until this point that you can even start to get those cool laser beams they advertise. You need help, period. Getting the high tech stuff requires multiple boss killings which flat out can’t be done without a team of high level players and high level dinos. But if you made it that far hat’s off to you.

I have never enjoyed single player games that much nor have I enjoyed platformers/metroidvanias, but this game changed my mind.

It envelops you into the world of Hallownest - a decrepit realm where an infection is sweeping over the ancient land. Every action you take in the game is related to the games lore. There is no meaningless grinding, no DLC that you have to pay for, no sense of urgency, etc.

The character you play as is adorable! (I know everyone says that, but I can't disagree)

The soundtrack is just perfection. It works with the games overall aesthetic, mood, tone, and even works alongside the game as almost a voice. The music helps submerge you into the game and is just intricate enough to notice, but not detract, from the gameplay itself. 

I only have 124 hours in the game. 84 hours and 53 minutes of that time is my first save where I am STILL TRYING TO GET 112% (I'm at 111%). The rest of the time has been restarts, modding runs, and general fun.

I personally use games as an... escape from reality, if you will. This game aces that concept.

=-=-=-=-=-=-
As for negatives:
For those of us new to platformers/metroidvanias there are some difficulty spikes. The good part is that the developers took this into account and did not make a majority of these areas a required area to complete the game, but instead made it ""extra credit.""

Additionally, the game does not describe what you are supposed to be doing all that clearly (at least to me) throughout the game. This led me to being a little lost in the beginning. I found this interesting because as I explored the game (which the map is ginormous) I came to understand what I was doing, why I was doing what I was doing, and what I was trying to accomplish. I was able to derive my own meaning out of it as a result and experience something unique to myself.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=

As for completion/story/lore research:
[u] I [b] HIGHLY [/b] discourage researching anything until [b] AFTER [/b] completing the game once. [/u]

Completing the game is a challenge regardless of skill level. It is a time commitment; something you will come back to day after day to first complete. Looking up a speedrun, completion help, etc. greatly detracts from the experience. However, I do understand that with such a large map and nothing to exactly point you in the right direction (is there one?) many will need help completing the game. So although I am discouraging research in order to help complete it, I respect that parts may become confusing. I would just encourage people to do it only if necessary.

For those of you who have completed it once and want more about lore, I'd promote [spoiler] mossbag [/spoiler] who can be found on YouTube.

I realize that because of difficulty spikes (as I have previously stated) many playing the game will lose hope. I, myself, have been stuck at 111% (as previously stated) for about 5-6 months. I took a break, but not because the game was bad. I am simply stuck at a part that has risen to a difficulty that I cannot beat... as of yet.

The one thing I have not said about the game that accentuates the fact that it is an absolute masterpiece is the fact that it rewards you for hard work. No matter how many times you go up against an enemy, their types of attacks will never change. It is the drive to beat what you originally could not that makes this game so special. Even now, as I am at 111%, I do not feel as if I am stuck, but that I just have not gotten the skills to beat it... YET.

I was shocked that I enjoyed the game as much as I did (and will continue to). I hope this review is useful to anyone interested. I try to be unbiased, but I know that everything is biased. I have highlighted all the main pros and cons that I feel that anyone interested in the game would maybe want to know ahead of time.

I have never played a Bioshock game before. I am thinking now, after beating this one that this was in error. This game is very fun for the price that I paid. 13 hours of non stop excitment and prime storytelling. Combat is good, crisp, and feel rewarding when youre doing well. Also quite challenging at times. The various magic powers are all distinct, cool, and useful, though I found myself favoring a few powers and weapons over others, but due to limited ammo, you will find yourself swapping weapons depending on the situation. 

Basically, for under $10, this game is perfect. The efficiency of entertainment here is real. There is little replay value as there is no real variation to the choices made in this game.

This game may be behind schedule and the situation with a paid DLC before finishing the game sucks, but when you actually look at the amount of content that these people are putting into it, and how nice they are to the community, I dont mind supporting them. I'de rather pay 40 dollars an alpha game that I'll spend 500+ hours rather than a game where I beat it, and all is left is a boring multiplayer and no replay ability.

Im going to list some pros and cons for the game.

Pros:
-Graphics are beautiful if youre computer can run it
-Constent updates and content added
-Mods
-Controls are very standart and easy to figure out
-Fun Multiplayer where you can actually get immersed into the game and be a part of the community.
-Very rewarding when you accomplish a feat in the game or even something small like building your first base or taming your first dino.
-Dinosaurs!

Cons:
-Occassionally buggy
-Some non official Server ping issues
-Official servers are way to grindy without friends
-Graphically demanding, not recomended for low budget builds.
-This is a survival game, so you will die A LOT your first time playing

Overall, If i was to rate this game i would give it a 7.5/10. The reasons why I give it this score is because this game is extremely enjoyable, and I look forward to the official release of patch 1.0 when it comes out, but its still an incomplete game. I am comparing this games to other big games though. Ive had more fun playing this game than 90% of the games on my playlist. This may not be the best game. But it is very good, and is definetly worth a buy when its on sale or if you wanna play with friends.

P.S. If you buy the game, convince some friends to play. Its a lot more fun when you can make fun of each other learning a brand new game ;)

5436577,DOOM Eternal,65838520,"Short form: If someone told me ""Eternal is like Doom 2016, but better,"" it probably wouldn't have piqued my interest enough. But no: Eternal is Doom 2016 expanded upon, rebuilt, re-reimagined, and polished. It took an already good game and expanded it into something great. 

Long form: Thematically, Doom Eternal is a male power fantasy, but also the sequel to Doom 2016 so it ends up serving two goals: Firstly, that the player is cool (even being referred to as superhuman and ""a god"" at one point) and secondly blood lust. To some degree, I felt the 2016 did this with more impressive artistry and the self-congradulations do grate on me. The hub area is a spaceship decorated more like a metal fantasy bacherlor pad than a place of work with lots of ""cool"" references to earlier games. For those who want a game to tell them how cool they are, it's probably great.

Our hero, named Slayer, has a number of really clever mechanics that lift Eternal beyond just twitch-reflex shooting. There's glory kills (one-shot deathblows for staggered) which always make the enemy drop health and power up the blood punch (a mele attack with high damage that radiates outward) that's good for crowd control, a chainsaw which causes enemies to spew ammo, the flame belch which makes them drop armor (especially on death), frag grenades, and frost grenades which stops enemies in place. In terms of mobility, you can swing on poles and dash twice on the ground or in the air. Both of the grenades refresh over time.

Cover is limited and usually an obstacle rather than a tool so health is a resource and makes glory kills and the flame belch important.  Ammo is also very limited which makes the chainsaw important. The shotgun can be very powerful, but charging at enemies to get into range can drain your health pool so dash, flame belch, shoot, glory kill, and onto the next target is a game loop you'll want to repeat often and with different weapons in order to diversify your ammo consumption and adapt to different enemies.

These mechanics coalless is into a simple strategy: Always be moving forward so you can see where you're going, even if that sends you past an enemy, check your resources, seek glory kills, and run circuits across the map. The maps are designed such that there is never a dead end and the paths twist around each other giving the player many options to mix up their strategy, mid encounter, but also include the occasional tunnel outside the action for momentary respite. Eternal is a rare example of a game where the designers had an intended way of play that is both the most fun way to play and optimal.

On the flip side, I will say that the rocket launcher often forced me to do more horizontal motion and sometimes even backpedal, generally being more of a liability than other weapons. The splash damage on the rockets will hurt you, you fall about as fast as they fly so it can't be used to kill a target where you're about to land without hurting and it also makes it difficult to advance on enemies. Meanwhile, moving horizontally or backwards are likely to get you killed. This makes it the least fun for me to use.

Also, the HUD can be unobtrusive to the point of not being useful at times, needing to keep the field of view clear but also inform the player of what resources they have available. It can be easy to miss things like not having enough fuel for the chainsaw.

Levels in Eternal are generally linear paths which can spill into combat arenas which sometimes act as hubs and branch off into secrets. You generally know where you're going, though there might be an ambiguous path to get there or a puzzle to solve which breaks up the pace. Litters of fodder demons are scattered about to keep the player from getting bored between combat arenas and loads of secrets and collectables to find for those patient enough to look. A simple, but effective formula. My only gripe is I missed a few things on two missions and the UI tries to help you with information about what you have left to find, but it can sometimes be unintentionally ambiguous.

Eternal is the first FPS I've played in a long time and I want to see more like this and less like realistic, cover-based military shooters.",1585206970,1585245052,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197993288712,842,22,2393,0,1202

19582109,XCOM 2,21176396,"Well, well, well: I must admit I was tempted to give XCOM 2 a ""thumbs down"" vote, if only because there is no option for a ""mixed"" review. Don't get me wrong, XCOM 2 is a good game that improves greatly on XCOM EU. It just leaves so much to be desired which some of it's predecessors in turn based strategy have succeeded to implement years ago. 
I love  games where can you lead a hand picked team of heroes through missions and level them up. That's what XCOM 2 does. However, while it has nice graphics and very nice ingame animations and makes it easier to identify with your squadmates than XCOM EU, games like Jagged Alliance 2 or Silent Storm still excell over XCOM 2 in so many aspects - other than the graphics - that one has to wonder if the devs ever had a look at those games.
Every bright aspect of this game (and there are many) thus seems to be countered by something lacking, missing or at least in need to be improved.
While the graphics are good and the ingame animations really fit in and add much to the atmosphere, the improved graphics come at a price: load times are a pain in - well you know where. Strange enough while the actual tactical gameplay is relatively smooth even on a five year old notebook (except for the last mission with tons of enemies), the strategic view is a framerate killer. Switching from one room on the Avenger to another seems to take forever, not to mention the holo globe on the command deck. 
Soldier customization is definetely better than in EU thanks to better graphics and a lot more hairstyles. On the other hand we do again get but six heads per gender/race half of which are ugly (at least we get bandanas!). Mens beards are plain awful as they never seem to match the hairstyles in colour and look like attached plastics. Maybe the devs should have taken a look at character creation in games like Saints Row 3 to see how this should be done. The choice of voice files is also limited, even to the point excluding languages like Russian or Polish which were present in EU, instead of adding some like Chinese, Japanese or Portugese. On the other hand the addition of ""stances"" is a very nice touch.
Thanks to the new graphics engine you can now demolish almost everything in tactical combat - which is fun, However Silent Storm while a much older game had similar options long before even XCOM EU and the graphics there can still compare with XCOM EU.
Tactical maps, while randomly generated, still look somewhat sterile. Cities in particular look nice but mostly deserted. And even though there are a few civilians around, they are actually obsolete. A missed opportunity, as they could have added a lot of fun to the game (Hey you fight a guerilla war to save mankind, so you should be forced to execute your missions without too much collataral damage to civilian life and infrastructure, instead of  turning whole blocks to rubble on a regular basis. This could have added a whole new layer of tactical challenge (Sneak around that mech or kill it with a rocket, gaining alloys at the price of damaged buildings, killed civies and  - in consequence - reduced intel and support?).
The game also seems way too short. While the start is relatively slow, with low funds, few engineers etc. the pace drastically improves later in the game. Story progression also accelerates with the doom timer ticking and everything seems to be rushing towards the end at some point. (Much better in Jagged Alliance 2, where you could play at your own leisure.) There's also the point about training your squad. You will most probably end up with an A, B perhaps a C-Team. But that's that. Loosing a number of high-level soldiers is a certain way to loose the game, since as the game moves on and the Aliens improve, you won't get enough easy missions to level up your rookies in time. An all rookie squad will simply be cannon fodder late game.
Engineering: You are fighting a guerilla war. Why instant build all weapons, once the tech is researched and you pay the price in supplies? This was much better in EU where you had to produce every single item, let alone in games like Silent Storm or Jagged Alliance, where you basically have to scavenge the battlefield for equipment. Combined with the ""loot timer"" already in the game such a feature would significantly have added to the feeling of guerilla warfare as well as made for nice ingame decisions (grab that gun/armor or reach the mission goal in time?). They could have added supply raid missions too. Oh shame for the missed opportunities! 
To sum it up: Should you buy the game: Yes, it's fun. But if you wait six months it will  probably be sold at a lower price and  modders will have added much to improve on many aspects and it will probably be even more fun. If you can wait that long, go grab Silent Storm here on Steam!",1455363940,1455523963,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198007427346,146,12,169484,375,9706

This game is filled with trolls and people who boost via IP locating, isolating, and forcing games with a single soul to suffer while they literally have 3 players playing for a team of 2.  (i.e. Two players team up and one player plays as a stand in for the other team.  The team you're on.) Epic doesn't care about this and it way easier to do since you can have multiple clients of the game as long as you have multiple accounts.  I've seen this as early as Halo 2 and pretty much you only allow your IP to team against another IP and block all other IPs so you force a match to where it's you and a buddy vs a random and you're extra account that is being run a second instance of the game being opened up.  Epic laughed when I accused them and I tried it myself.  It worked.  Having a hard time ranking up? Witness this much?  Yup, that because this exist in this game.  Sad but true.  At least when the game was buy to play, the company made more money if someone wanted to do this.  Now, with it being free to play, it doesn't matter.  AT ALL.  Not to the company controlling the game, but also to any players.  This can happen in tourneys too and it's so sad.  Join up and a team gets an IP address off any of the players and they can lock the others out from being able to join in.  What happens?  Your team forfeits the match.  You lose.  Great game.  Would recommend.  The people that say that are probably paid.

That would rather sacrifice realism for cool new gadgets. I want to feel like an Special force agent, not some wanna-be sci-fi character. Its ok with friends.
Graphics are good it's the gameplay that sucks way too often.

Community sucks.
Gameplay issues dont get adressed.(right now its a sound bug)
3D sound is really horrible.(IT INVERTS, this has been an issue for a long time now.)
Spawn killing is rampant and really unfriendly for new players.
Hip-fire is basically non-existent to an unreal level breaks immersion everytime.
Operator skills are always OP on release for a quick cash grab and then get nerfed into oblivion.(e.g. Lion and Blackbeard)
The game tried to be realistic at one point, now we got holograms, Nano-bot health boosts, hacking spider drones, cameras with lasers that burrow through walls, indestructible movement slowers, a grenade absorbing magnet, gas masks that are just for show, attachments that are completly useless etc.
If ur looking for immersion in a Terrorist/Counterterrorist setting...

Dawn of War 3 has taken the franchise in a completely different direction the results of which are a crisp smooth and true to the genre gaming experience which could honestly pass as at a competitive level. This game will be enjoyed by old school RTS fans, gamers that used to enjoy classic RTS titles such as C&C Generals, Red Alert, or even Warcraft 3. 

The game offers 3 races for players to master, whilst this number may seem small each of these races is vastly more developed than was offered in previous titles. Each faction boasts far more units than previous titles and more importantly each unit feels distinct. Where previous titles would give a unit simple and boring abilities (SM devastators ""press q for bonus dmg"") most if not all units in DoW3 have been given distinctive, significant, and intuitive abilities. On top of this each race has their own unique faction mechanics that add variety to the game.

DoW3 introduces to players powerful Hero units that feel reminiscent of Jarmen's, Tanya's, and Thrall's, modernising them with MOBA style skill shot, cone, and AOE template style abilities. These Heroes add an extra layer of depth onto an already deep classic RTS foundation.

As a result of these changes the old DoW2 crowd will likely hate the game just as DoW2 was such a huge let down to many of the orginals most loyal fans. Seeing as DoW2 was a steaming hot turd; offering less than the game that it re-skinned this can only be taken as a good thing!",1493403919,1493403919,True,2,0,0,True,False,76561198039174493,102,2,4999,0,1627

15484906,Monster Hunter: World,65488884,"As a long-time fan of the Monster Hunter series (I've been following since near after the release of MH3 Ultimate in North America), I felt utterly compelled to write a review after my recent experiences with the game.

This is more aimed at veteran Monster Hunter fans, but I feel like there is still a lot to take away from this review as a newcomer, so I'll try my best at explaining some stuff.

--------AS A MONSTER HUNTER FAN--------

Atmosphere / Visual direction:

If you're like me and have taken an extreme liking to the atmosphere and general charisma that Monster Hunter titles have historically had, then you might be somewhat disappointed. I won't beat around the bush; the game is a little 'grittier' than the previous titles, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. But if you've grown to love the ""So tasty!~"", your lances that look like sharks, your dual blades that look like a fork and knife, your hammers that look like blimps, then I can tell you that there isn't very much of that. Capcom, from what I can tell, has chosen to opt-out of the wackyness in favor of a more accessible, familiar realistic art direction that honestly is pretty good, but is certainly not what you're used to. Just be warned.

However , I personally think the new art direction does wonders for the monsters they've chosen to add, in particular. The monsters almost look and behave like they could exist in the real world. in that regard, this game is a HUGE step up from the previous titles. Not to mention the overwhelming attention Capcom has put into this game's environments. Gone are the segmented puzzle-piece-like maps of old. Instead each map is one great big sandbox, each with it's own theme and structural style. The environments truly make this game feel like a WORLD instead of a weird stitched together mess.

You have areas like Ancient Forest and Rotten Vale which are visual spectacles (even on the lowest settings) and focused on emphasizing verticality and height, and you have areas like Elder's Recess and Wildspire Waste which are more focused on large open plains and craggly rocky paths that make you really feel like you're there. My point is, each map is easily identifiable, memorable, and very distinct and unique from the rest. Not to mention extremely gorgeous in their own right.

Gameplay:

My favourite change in the entire series has to be with the environmental interactions that Capcom has introduced in this game. Maps in the previous games were basically just a stage with props; essentially, just a background for where you fight. Monster Hunter: WORLD, however, decided to really bring the idea of ""WORLD"" home. The environment is so alive, there's so much to do besides killing monsters with big swords. There are lots of clever traps and goodies scattered throughout each and every map, that learning a map is almost like learning the patterns of a monster.

Some maps have boulder traps that let you drop a big boulder onto the monster if you position them properly. Others have vine traps that let you pin the monster down for a ton of free hits if you pay attention and play well. Are you a heavy weapon that struggles to do any aerial hits, yet you long to slap monsters with a gigantic sword in the air? There are cleverly placed beetles throughout the maps that you can use your slinger on (basically a multi-purpose arm attatchment every hunter now has) to launch into the air and reposition for some aerial damage. It's so rewarding and fresh compared to the previous games that, honestly, I can't ever see myself going back to the segmented boring map style. There is nothing like learning the ins and outs of a particular map and just absolutely decimating a monster with that knowledge. It just adds yet another layer of skilled play that is just incredibly rewarding and fun.

WEAPONS. The next best thing they've done in terms of gameplay is flesh out each weapon's gameplay styles and movesets, and it's honestly the direction I hope they keep going with in the future. If you've played MH before, none of the weapons should feel foreign whatsoever; Their core moveset is more or less identical to the previous iterations. However, it feels as though this time Capcom took inspiration from the Hunter Arts / Styles (a mechanic from a previous Monster Hunter title, Generations / Generations Ultimate that let you perform big flashy finishing moves or change the way a weapon is played) and simply wove those ideas into each weapon. Essentially it feels as though every weapon has a unique ""special move."" For instance, Long sword now has a counter-attack built into it's moveset (which was previously a ""Hunter art""), and a special ""Spirit Helm Breaker"" special move that changes how you look at your spirit gauge. Bow now has a ""Dragon Piercer"" special move that changes the way you think about how you position yourself when monsters are vulnerable (On a slight tangent, the ranged weapons have been incredibly streamlined and have never been easier to get into and play). That isn't to say the weapons weren't varied in previous titles, but they quite honestly feel more set apart from each other than they have been in the previous 4 games I've played. And some weapons felt woefully complicated, even as a somewhat veteran player, in the previous games. That is more or less completely gone in this game, and I am incredibly thankful for it.

So if you've played a ton of Monster Hunter before and are worried that you'll get bored of the weapons, I wouldn't worry at all. Every weapon feels so good to play in this game, so familiar yet new, that I think you can fall in love with your favourite weapon all over again, no matter how many hundreds of hours you've sunk into it.

Monsters:

This one's kind of a big deal if you're a Monster Hunter fan like myself. I touched on the monsters a bit earlier in my visual direction section, but I feel like they're such an important topic that they need a paragraph of their own.

Monsters set the tone of the game. They make or break the environment. They determine the look / feel of your weapons and armor. They're what you're going to be seeing all the time, seeing as you're a Monster Hunter. So they'd better be good right?

I can tell you that the choice of monsters in this game is, while wonderful and interesting, pretty lacking as well. There are just not a lot of monsters in the game compared to previous titles, and I don't feel as though they're quite varied enough in terms of body type and their fantasies. Previous titles had tons of crazy outlandish monsters that were just so unique and cool that you had to fall in love with them. Monsters like Zinogre, a thunder wolf that channels lightning (he literally strikes himself with it from the sky) to charge up and essentially go full super-saiyan, are so fantastic and mystical, which I feel is the kind of thing lacking in this particular title.

Granted, their choices of Elder Dragons like Teosta, Kushala Daora, and the brand new Elder Dragon Val Hazaak are more or less in line with the fantasy vibe I was outlining earlier. But those are Elder Dragons. They are supposed to fit this bill. But even the previous games had some engaging, fantasy-yet-believable regular old monsters: Brachydios with his explosive saliva that he coats his almost boxing glove-like hands to punch and blast you with, Qurupeco with the ability to mimic other monsters' cries and just call on any monster it wants. Those are just a few examples I could name off the top of my head. Bazelgeuse definitely stands out and fills this void though.

I'm actually at the character limit surprisingly (I have a lot to say lol) so I'm unable to talk about the rest of the game. I think I hit the key points however. But as a fan of MH overall, I cannot recommend this game enough. Please give it a try, it's absolutely worth your time.

16885249,No Man's Sky,24952173,"Seeing all the hate towards this game I will put my two cents in it.

Playing it nearly for 40 hours I can establish a clear opinion what I think of this game.

First of all it is not for everyone and it will never be. Second of all I feel like this game is a just a barebones of what we will see in the future hopefully. 

What I liked about this game:

Seeing no trailers and following no hype train I was amazed on how the world in this game looks, all the fauna and flora, etc.
The controls while in planet are quite easy to manage and even beginners without any knowledge of controls or surrounding should not have much problems managing to get around.
The variety of textures and sounds is plentiful for this game and It's quite enjoyable to travel around and find new things.
All the upgrades (ship, exosuit, multi-tool) are more than enough to keep you occupied for hours wondering from planet to planet trying to find the materials necessary to upgrade, so it just prolongs the quality time with this game.
Music compiled for this game takes a very good turn for it as it's relaxing, comfortable and you don't get tired of it.

The fixable stuff
The lack of flight controls really puts a dent in this game. The worst part being the while in planet ship automatically takes some flight controls off from you so you are left with just going left or right and barrel rolls just to see what's one the ground. 
Ship battles are probably the most difficult thing in this game as of moment when you are put straight into 1v20 fight against pirates just as you warp in. Experimenting with the fight I noticed that freight ships do a non-existent damage to pirate ships so they are little to no help and if you hit them accidentally a few times you start shooting at you as well with incredible accuracy. So you are left in even worse position fighting against not only pirate but also the ones that send a distress signal. As for the pirate ships - they really lack more advanced AI, flying in straight lines  then taking a U-turn while going towards you and shooting nonstop. While it would lower the difficulty or I have yet to meet it, the freight ships could send out their own fight ship to help the player against the pirates.

The lack of lore. Probably the biggest thing I would like to see is some lore scattered across the galaxies that would tell you on how the Atlas appeared, its pre-history and their connection to the present times.
Also Atlas so called ""Gods"" in anomalies are scary as shit.

Beacon info. Instead of showing one place in the far away distance it could also add what shelters, stations and ruins are close to beacons proximity.

The pin-able recipes on your visor when gathering materials for any upgrade as well as material count included or shield recharge function without pressing tab and doing it manually wasting precious seconds in extreme planets or space fights.

And many more stuff I would like to see added (and will probably expand this to never-ending list) but once again as I mentioned - it is still a barebones game and I expect a lot of stuff to be added that will make the experience even more better, so just hoping that the money spent for it will pay off on long road.

For now I give this a 7.5/10

1. The camera angles. My lord, when you're in a battle, the camera goes literally all over the place. It's near impossible to use a gun because of this. 
2. When you lock onto a target, it reduces your mobility, but the auto aim without it is really weird; you could be directly facing the opponent you want to attack and suddenly find yourself slashing right or left at someone else. 
3. Sometimes the controls don't work. You might have full stamina and blood, but sometimes your powers won't work. Some powers I understand only work at certain distances, but I deal with this problem using long and close range powers alike. 
4. There's a lot to keep track of. Yes, you can evolve to make your blood and stamina bars bigger, but it's frustrating that I have to keep track of both. However, I guess you could say this adds to the immersion and difficulty of the game: keep in mind, you WILL die a few times; I don't think it's possible to play this game without dying at least once. 
5. WAAAY too much pointless dialogue. Jonathan is literally London's biggest gossip.

11709231,Dying Light,33248362,"[i]TL;DR at bottom[/i]

[b][h1]I'm two years late to the hype train, and this game is still amazing.[/h1][/b]
I was unsure of buying it at first, because a lot of the negative reviews said the some questionable things about it.

| COMPLAINTS |                 | ARGUMENTS |               |
| The combat is bad!            | You're bad at the game.    |             
| It's buggy and laggy!          | You have a bad computer |
| Only the freerunning is fun! | Play Mirror's Edge           |

JUST TO BE CLEAR: The game is not buggy or terribly optimized. It's actually very smooth. Remember in Mirror's Edge when you'd grab onto something and your hands would be in a set animation/place, making it sometimes look like your hands are grabbing onto nothing? This game fixes that. Whenever you grab onto something, just like real life, your hands will shift to grab onto the closest object. So if you grab onto a corner, your hands will be placed closer or farther away to avoid going off of the corner.

Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I can state the pros and cons of Dying Light.
Cons first, because I want to end on a good note.

[h1][b][i]CONS[/i][/b][/h1]
[list]
    [*]I agree with others that it does seem to take a couple too many hits to kill a zombie. The combat can be slighty unreliable because of random critical hits. Sometimes it'll take seven or eight swings to kill a zombie (with a decent one-handed weapon) and other times it'll instantly kill them. You can, however, knock them down with a well-timed heavy attack and hit a finishing blow, but you can only unlock finishing blows a bit later on in the skill tree.

    [*]I feel that during cutscenes the camera zooms in a little bit too much, but your eyes adjust to it within a few seconds.

    [*]THE GRAPPLING HOOK. I'm not putting it in the cons because it's broken or glitchy at all. In fact, it works very well. I just don't think it fits the game's style. As soon as you get the grappling hook, a lot of the parkour is ruined. Normally, you'd have to find your way to a neighbouring building assassins creed style, but with the grappling hook you can just fly there with ease. It removes a lot of the satisfaction in finding your own way to traverse the map, so I will tell you to get it at the last second and only use it when you have to. I don't know if it's just me, but when you're in multiplayer and 3 out of the 4 people don't have grappling hooks and that one guy just flys straight to the objective using one is such a joykill. Working as a team is my favorite part about the Co-op mode, and it ruins a lot of that. The grappling hook should be a way to go to places when there's no clear route; not a way to bypass the freerunning. I won't use it in Co-op unless the rest of the team has grappling hooks and agrees to use them. This segment was a bit long, and maybe it's just me being sensitive, but I felt the need to express that.

    [*][b]MICROPHONE CHAT IS BAD[/b]. This is the only thing about the game that I just don't like. Others are just minor nuiscances or annoyances, but this is just terrible. By enabling voice chat in the settings [b][i](it's enabled by default)[/i][/b] it sets your microphone to [i]OPEN MIC[/i]. There's no way to change it to push to talk unless you set a manual bind on your keyboard to mute and unmute. Most people obviously don't want it on open mic and don't have the software to make a manual bind, so they just end up turning off voice chat which - [i]you guessed it[/i] - makes it so you can't hear anyone else talking. So it's either use open mic, or talk in text chat. The worst part is, most people don't realize it's defaulted to this, so if you have it on you can hear everything on everyone elses microphone. Modern games nowadays have fixed this issue, but I would've expected it fixed for Dying Light, even if it's a 2015 game.
[/list]

[h1][i][b]PROS[/b][/i][/h1]
[list]
    [*]The storyline is surprisingly good compared to other games of this genre. The final missions were especially intense.

    [*]It's been said before, and I'll say it again. The freerunning is amazing. It can feel slow at first, but once you get the first few agility upgrades you'll be flowing like water.

    [*]Techland completely nailed night time in Dying Light. There's nothing scarier than being super far away from a safehouse, your watch beeps, you look down and see 20:00 written across your watch, and then that ominous message comes up, along with the ear-piercing screams of Volatiles coming out from hiding. [i]""Night is coming.""[/i] During the night, fast and strong zombies known as [b]Volatiles[/b] appear. As soon as one sees you, [i]you run as fast as you can[/i] and try to lose it. Volatiles can climb buildings [b]just as well as you can,[/b] so don't think you're so lucky when you're climbing as high as you can to escape.

    [*]I never even knew this until I bought the game, but there's multiplayer PvP and Co-op modes. I can't explain in words how it feels to have three other players at your side, climbing buildings and working together to stay alive during the night.

    [*]Crafting weapons and gathering supplies are some of the most essential parts of Dying Light. I love it so much, because it's so easy to understand. There are no materials that need to be made by combining other materials. In case you don't understand, this is what I mean. When you craft, you use the raw ingredients you found, and you don't need to do anything else. Need to make a medkit? Put some gauze and alchohol together. Want to make an electric sword? Combine metal and electronic parts. I don't care that it's not totally realistic; I just want my electric sword. You can even craft anything right after the intro mission. As soon as you're free to explore, you can find the materials you need, buy a blueprint from a shop, and make it. There's no bullshit [i]""crafting skill""[/i] you have to upgrade.

    [*]I [b]love[/b] the main enemy you're working against. That's not to say there's only one, though. At the start of the game, it seems so painfully clear, but as you progress you start to question what cause you're working for. Some of the enemies are more obvious than others, and my personal favorite is the bad guy you see for most of the game.  In almost every scenario when you encounter him, he's so unpredictable that you can't tell what he's going to do next. At random times he'll shoot and kill his own men seemingly unprovoked just to prove how feared he is.
    [*]The game even has filters. If you go into the game options you can change the game to look red, blue, black & white, have an old-style television film grain effect, and much more. It's great for recording cinematics.

    [*]It has a 15 hour campaign, and that's without doing side-quests.

Dying Light is an amazing game. Please get it. It can go as low as $20 on sale, which sounds like a lot, but trust me. It's worth every penny.

16667716,ARK: Survival Evolved,23690462,"I've played this game since release and purchased it twice, worth every penny and I give her a 10/10!

The way Ark has grown from a thatch hut builder to a game that dominates the survival genre isn't surprising, Wildcard have done everything right. The game has grown from less than 20 creatures to over 120, across 4 official maps and growing close to 20 unofficial. The modding community in itself is huge, anything from game-changing overhauls to very minor tweaks of the game mechanics, there's something for everybody and Wildcard's enthustic approach to encourage the growth of the Workshop is fantastic.

The performance is demanding but it is not unplayable like most reviews insist, I've tried Ark on 4 different systems and the results are as follows.

- Q8400/R7 250 2GB/8GB Ram > Low/medium settings, sliggish with minor spikes but very playable with launch settings.
- 2600K/GTX 1070/16GB Ram > Ultra, flawless performance.
- i7 3930K/1050Ti 4GB/16GB Ram > High settings, no performance issues whatsoever other than the odd structure loading spike.
- i7 3930K/R9 Fury 4GB/16GB Ram > As above with extra fps and a little less structure demand.
- i7 7700K/1080Ti 11GB/32GB Ram > Completely maxed with flawless performance.
- 6950X/1080Ti SLI/64GB Ram > Maxed 4K res, flawless performance.

NOTE: Naturally prior to optimisation - any reviews stating ""a medium to ultra PC"" having issues is down to the PC and not Ark. If an i7/GTX9xx can't run it but an R7 250 and a Q8400 can, then Ark isn't the problem.

232809,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,56059099,"The Witcher 3 is a surprisingly rich RPG filled with solid gameplay and a wonderful narrative, though not without faults.

The gameplay was solid, and took a level of learning and mastery rarely seen in today's titles. It wasn't anything close to Dark Souls, but the difficulty felt right, and you could tell as you made progress and improved your skills. There's a wide level of customization for any playstyle, whether it's skills or armor.

The game looks gorgeous, especially considering it came out in 2015, and it's optimized very well. Textures seem real, colors pop out, and the world feels alive. The weather effects are very convincing, often blending together with other particles to create a convincing scene.

The beginning and end of the Witcher 3 are well written, and have a fair pace. The middle, however, leaves much to be desired. The game also throws a huge amount of content in your face as soon as you start, and makes it incredibly easy to burn out. Unfortunately, that's what happened to me. 

The majority of the middle of the game takes place in Novigrad and Skellige. After doing a ton of quests and exploration and Velen, I was pretty much done at that point. The city of Novigrad seemed boring and repetitive, and I was bored to death of the storyline there. When I got to Skellige, I did the bare minimum and got out.

If I could go back and do it all over again, I would read the Witcher book series and play the first two games to have more context in the story. While it is still understandable, there's a lot of details not explained by the game that would be cleared up by reading the books. 

Overall, the Witcher 3 was a good game, I enjoyed it, even with its issues. If you have the time, I'd recommend picking it up and diving into the world of Geralt.

12471446,Black Mesa,32811867,"So far, I can say that Black Mesa is a great effort to remake an absolute classic that was the original Half-life. 

All chapters are so unique, yet so close to the original maps that I'm still amazed after 5 hours of playthrough. Even though almost all assets are made from scratch, you can really recognize each and every location, even with their own unique design decisions. Office Complex and Questionable Ethics are my favorite segments of HL1, and that didn't change on Black Mesa. Crowbar Collective managed to bring the impossible to life, both in terms of atmosphere and also gameplay.

Being an Early Access game, it still has its flaws. Almost all of the ""Performance"" options under  ""Black Mesa"" tab are not well optimized, lowering the FPS to below 50 in some open areas. Helpful tip: never turn on God Rays. There are some issues with dynamic lightning that are still present even after 2 years of early access (according to some forum posts here on Steam and on their official website).

Overall, I can't simply deny the outstanding experience I'm having so far. I'll definitely play more of the game and even reach the end eventually, but so far I'm impressed with their effort.

It's one of the few games that I've watched the video, thought ""That looks awesome,"" and had the game live up to the expectation.

So what is it? Well, the campaign is pretty short - really more of an extended tutorial, so I'll talk about the Free Play. It's kind of survivalish, in that you start as a dude with a pickaxe on an alien world with hostile fauna. From there, you build up your mega-factory-complex-of-awesome by building increasinly complex stuff from 6 base resources (copper, iron, oil, coal, wood, water). And automation is the foundation layer of the game. So you can have automated mines pulling ore from the ground, which then gets loaded into an automated train, which hauls it to your automated smelting center, which feeds your automated factory complex. It's beautiful.

501083,Half-Life,47927361,"Half-life, the game that took the world by storm and became one of the biggest phenomena in the gaming world and then turned into a meme and just died off. Everything started with this game, I played this game after 20 years of its initial release. I was never into the half-life band wagon, since i started my gaming venture roughly 11 years after this games release. I always wondered what is all the fuss about. Being played now I can safely say that ""Well how did I missed it for this long time"".
As you might have assumed already the game holds up pretty well (for the most part at least). The game has popularized many of the troupes that are can be seen even today like the in engine cut scenes where you have the full control of your character.
The experience with the game started very sorely to say the least. The very first scene where Gordon is in the tram and the voice that tell the all the usual things about safety and the tram moves slowly to the destination was not as punching as I thought. It was touted as one of the most famous opening scenes in the whole gaming history. But for me it was just another opening scene with ugly textures and blocky character models. I was just disappointed but kept up with it. Well the best decision made in a long while. After an hour or so into the game something just clicked with me (the story of course). I was going through all the rooms, listening to all the characters, killing all the Headcrabs, zombies, bullsquids, barnacle tongues and vortigaunts, squashing all the boxes, ignoring all the ugly textures and blocky character models. I was hooked. I have to say, if you are like me means started gaming in the call of duty era then you might be as spoiled as me by the constant spoon feeding of the objectives, map markers and radars you’ll find this game too confusing as there are no radars or mini maps or not even the objectives. I looked up some guides online and just kept going, till the very end
The gameplay is very standard you move from point a to b by solving some environment puzzles and killing enemies. There are wide verities of enemies to kill. All kind of aliens and then the zombies and the marines. The game has all the standard weapons like knife, pistols, shotgun, sub machines guns and few types of explosives. There are some unusual one like the gauss gun and gluon gun etc. The official expansion opposing force added some more weapons to the mix.
But there are some things that I didn’t like about the game. Mainly the movement. In felt like the whole black mesa facility floors were covered in grease. You can’t move accurately. It always felt off like I am skiing. It was the main gripe for me during the puzzles where you need to jump from one moving ledge to other and little bit of over movement will drop you to your death. The second thing that I hated are the puzzles itself they were not well explained and felt tedious. I found myself constantly searching for the guides. 
The game has a fairly good checkpoint system and I never found myself repeating more than 5 mins of the game because I died or messed up.
The 2 official expansion packs the “opposing force” and “blue shift” are really good as well they add another 10 or so hours to the game, and if you are like me and want to squeeze every bit of the story from the half-life then these expansions are really worth it. Over all if you call yourself a gamer and never played this game then you are lying to yourself. Listen to me you never played this game (that’s extremely unlikely, but still) just get it and the expansions as well. I just hope that valve get its act together and start producing these masterpieces again.

17638062,Rise of the Tomb Raider,28929289,"Mechanically better than it's predecessor, especially because they got rid of most of the QTE junk. The story suffers the same problem of being generally uninteresting, you don't have much reason to be attached to the other characters, and there isn't such a overwhelming ludonarrative dissonance. Again like the previous game, if you are good at shooting, then the final fights are just as trivial as the first.

What makes this game (and not to harp too much, but again like it's previous title) is the optional tombs, and the world. They create such cool cities and ruins, and create some fun and cool puzzles, and the combat can feel weighty and scrappy.

Not exactly what I wanted out of the sequel though, it's more of the same but slightly better. Problem is Lara doesn't grow at all in this one, which is what drew me into the reboot a few years ago. I do like this game, but it feels like they missed an opportunity here to make The Dark Knight to their Batman Begins reboot, but instead they just treaded water.

20910758,Yakuza 0,69442237,"POSITIVES:
+ Story is very entertaining with plenty of twists to keep you interested.
+ Solid Japanese voice-acting & cutscene performances. Overall the English text seems to do a very good job of capturing the emotion of each scene. 
+ Plenty of video options available including framerate cap & FOV slider. Supports very high refresh rates & resolutions.
+ Combat feels fluid and provides you with a wide varierty of attacks that crunch when they connect with enemies, causing satisfying explosions of money that they drop.
+ Prior to key boss fights, there's a pre-match Vs. screen that pops up, similar to what you'd see in a 1-on-1 fighting game. It's a small touch that really makes it feel like each boss battle is a big event.
+ It's not difficult to avoid random encounters if need be.
+ The open world is extremely dense, detailed and quickly traversable.
+ The three metagames present will each take you several hours to play to completion.
+ There's a notebook that provides a breakdown of who each character is & their motivations should you forget. You can easily rewatch cutscenes.
+ The perk system is tied to an in-game achievement system, which rewards you for trying all the different side events should you choose to do so.

NEGATIVES:
- Your characters quickly becomes overpowered. I was basically destroying the bosses in a minute or two on the hardest difficulty. If you want a real challenge from the combat then you'll need to find some rare pieces of equipment that nerf your stats. If you want a real challenge, you'll only find that in the higher levels of the mini-games.
- About an hour or two into the game you'll have enough money that you can buy just about every item in the stores. Your instant wealth trivializes the in-game economy.
- The game gives you an English list of all the available properties that you can buy on the menu screen. The problem is that when you're running around on the map looking for specific properties to buy, most of the store names are obviously in Japanese. This language disconnect forces you to run up to every single storefront to see if a prompt pops up to buy that location. If you happen to miss one of these pop-up prompts, you'll need to repeat the process for every store in that area.
- Some of the tutorials for the optional Japanese card mini-games are lacking & will require you to do a bit of research outside the game.
- You can't delete unneeded save files.
- The vast majority of the smaller side-quests boil down to just making a couple of dialog choices & concluding with a short fight.
- The emulated arcade games interpret the use of a controller's analog stick as if was a digital input, making those games more difficult to control compared to playing the game on a real arcade machine. Additionally the emulators run with a bileanar filter which blurs the games' displays.

BUGS:
+ The game never crashed once even after hundreds of hours of playtime.
- Recurring graphical glitch where the Sotenbori ground texture would become stretched & distorted when viewed at certain angles. There's also some rare, very specific situations where you'll see animation, texture & illumination bugs.
- There are some very rare text-formatting issues.
- There's some rare instances of in-game achievements being swapped around. For example, you may need to do Action A to unlock Achievement B, Action B to unlock Achievement C, & Action C to unlock Achievement A. You can't depend on the in-game achievement tracking to accurately tell you what you have & haven't done yet for those bugged achievements and it may take you a while to realize there's an issue at all.

A PvE server you only have to worry about Dinosaurs and come across players that will still rob you blind if you can not lock your base. But many players will team up and even trade for the purpose of the end game or just to have a good time,

15629069,Monster Hunter: World,46284461,"Review:

   Capcom did a great job on introducing new elements and integrated into one of their successful IP, a strong solid foundation and a bold move to introduce new elements made monster hunter world to become one of the most outstanding game they have created. The brand new monster ecosystem and variety of monster and creatures really make the player feel it is another living world inside the game, which make it even more interesting to explore compare to previous sequel. 

   The debut of slinger, new monster ecosystem, and changeable environment created richer gameplay experience. The story telling part is much more engaging than previous game, cutscenes and some narrative dialogs make you feel the story actually is there and have some story to tell instead of just some extra information you will receive while progressing some important quest which most probably just serves as some setting to make the quest looks more reasonable to proceed in previous game.       

Pros:
1. Allow variety of play-style to hunting monster.
2. Stunning visual presentation upgrade compare to previous game
3. Interesting ecosystem environment make you feel like a real world
4. More interesting and engaging story compare to previous game
5. Constantly deliver new update/content and event/activities

Cons:
1. Lack of variety armor and weapon design compare to previous game, most of them just like different skin on a same weapon

It's pretty despicable that a primarily cosmetic DLC was put out before a patch was developed. It doesn't really seem like they'll ever fix it for some reason.

Also ""Anti-Aliasing"" is MSAA, not standard AA. Do not set it to higher than 2x unless you have an absolutely killer video card. I left mine at 2x with a GTX 1070 and got between 55 and 60 fps pretty consistently (minus cutscenes, which play at 30 fps for some reason).

Despite that, I would still recommend it. It took me 35 hours to complete the main story components along with the majority of side-quests, so the amount of entertainment is pretty impressive. The storyline was a roller coaster of emotion with no mercy.

It is also worth noting that the music is phenominal. It was not an after-thought or secondary element like most games. The music is dynamic and deepens the awe and emotions of the story elements and world locations. It's also probably the only game I've played that actually had lyrics in it (sometimes). Most were in ""chaos language"", which I actually found quite nice.

Make sure you finish endings A-E... you haven't really beaten the game until you do so.

Ultimately, I'm recommending it because I do not regret my purchase. If they just fixed the resolution bug, the reviews probably wouldn't be so conflicted.",1497240366,1497240366,True,1,0,0,False,False,76561197992675700,143,2,3136,0,2535

Coming from a guy who has grown up playing video game's through my year's of life as we call it, this game shocked me. Now when i say shocked i don't mean that in a bad way necessarily, it just made my jaw drop in complete shock once i wrapped my brain around everything that was happening all at once. I even had to go back and play it again to fully understand everything and i most likely am still not done exploring, but that doesn't change the fact of how crazy of an adventure i had with this (Visual Novel / Horror / Anime).

Here's my summed up -Review-
   Love the game over all 10/10 on my book, very crazy roller coaster of emotion's, shock, and plain right horror experience for a visual novel. I definetly recommend this for anyone who love's Visual Novel Anime in general, plus it's (free) so it's a win in my book. Great work to Team Salvato for making me cry and cry again....

The gameplay is very easy to understand after learning how to use the first machines since every machine works very similarly, it's fun and engaging, BUT I've encountered a ton of gameplay affecting bugs which bother me a lot.

This is my current list of bugs I've encountered so far:
- Foundations being invisible after being built and turn visible only after I save the game.
- Deconstructed buildings not disappearing, but instead becoming non-solid visible objects.
- Conveyors not bulling items and start working only after the conveyor is rebuilt.
- In the jungle looking area random trees suddenly appearing and disappearing next to me.
- Random invisible movement blocking objects in the jungle area.
- Getting stuck into/onto trees without being able to move until I break the tree with a chainsaw.

As a bit of a medieval history nerd its great to finally have a decent RPG that doesn't involve crazy wizards dragons and magic.

One of the main complaints I had heard was that the combat is very clunky and difficult. and it certainly feels like that at the start. The combat feels more calculated than other games with similar combat systems such as Mordhau, while in that game they've gone for smoothness and speed, Kingdom come has gone for a slower, more grounded in reality approach that feels great once you learn it.

Its also worth noting that as you start as a blacksmiths son, decisions like having you die quickly in combat early on make sense from a role-playing standpoint, as there is a good chance a blacksmiths son would not know how to fight or defend himself, by playing the game, your character improves his skills and by the end you feel a lot more like an unstoppable warrior.

The game does still have its problems, visual bugs and voice acting being the most noticeable for me. But id say the game is well worth it if your interested in the historical background, and want a slightly more realistic take on a medieval historic RPG

The game is much more fluid than the previous in every aspect - combat, load times and progression with beautiful visuals and great environment interactivity BUT sadly CAPCOM have somehow managed to spectacularly fall short with the online multiplayer, I have never had a problem connecting to sessions or other players on the PSP, PS1, PS2 and the nintendo wii U which are all now inferior to the PC and PS4 so how can they possibly fail with the online connectivity with this superior hardware? All of the online features and the way you connect/play with others is identical to previous games so how hard can it be to get something that was already perfected to work on better hardware and presumably better servers as times have moved on??

The conectivity issues have completely ruined one of best aspects of this whole game - HUNTING WITH YOUR FRIENDS!! So far after trying atleast 50 times I have been able to connect to one of my friends and play through 1 quest, YES just 1 quest to completion...all other times the game gives you an error message and kicks you with no option to reconnect to that friend to carry on. How can you create such a masterpiece then fall short with something like that, it's not as if we are connecting to 99 other players to do a battle royale, just 3 other players and you cannot make that work...?

8253171,Hades,76516732,"[b]THE LOOK[/b]

Since 2011, Supergiant Games have been the kings and queens of stylish video game presentation, combining heart-pounding music with jaw-dropping visuals. They've somehow elevated their trademark with this one. Hades manages to give Greek mythology, a setting that's certainly been well-trod in recent years, a new identity with a cast of amazingly rendered characters and beautiful environments. Each god and shade has a vibrant design that perfectly captures the essence of their particular myth and every level of Hell leaves a distinct impression. 

[b]THE FEEL[/b]

Gameplay is kind of important in a roguelike because you're mostly going to be doing the same thing over and over and over. The core loop has to feel satisfying and the RPG elements have to create a sense of variety in each individual run. Luckily, Hades is blessed with just that. 

Want to smash enemies into walls and rupture their bodies? Want to use a crit-fueled rapid fire bow? Want to gather everything up and punch the baddies full of drunkenness? In Hades, there are countless ways to break this game wide open and do so, so much damage. And really, what's the point of a roguelike, if not that? With a combination of unique weapons, boons from the Olympian gods, and other upgrades, you can fully customize each time you try to escape. 

[b]THE STORY[/b]

Wait, a roguelike with a story? Yep. This is what makes Hades so magical. It has so much freaking character. Literally. There's something like 14,000 voice lines in this game, all spoken by characters who are witty, terrifying, and cute in turn. All of them have distinct personalities, and each help propel you along an emotional story that advances every time you complete a run. Not only that, but there are so many little side stories packed into this game to uncover. I've played this thing for 70+ hours and I know there is so much dialogue and lore that I haven't even seen yet. 

I have been a fan of Supergiant since the beginning, but this is far and away their best product yet. It's one of those extremely rare video games that nails it in every possible respect, and I salute this team of developers for all the work they've done to get to this point. Thank you for taking me on this splendid journey.",1601007522,1601054087,True,1,0,0,True,False,76561198010827789,474,10,4384,0,4382

21148315,Europa Universalis IV,13984018,"EUIV is a fantastic grand strategy game. If you like strategy then this is simply one of the best games that you can buy.

It is the most accessible of the Paradox grand strategy games and definitely the most friendly for a new player. Having said that, it is also probably the toughest to master. The mechanics are deep and complex, and it is the case that you will probably still be learning new things even after playing for hundreds of hours. 

EUIV requires a high level of strategic thinking but it is also a game about stories. It is always interesting to look through the map at different corners of the globe and see how a new divergent history is playing out during each play-through. Of course, the real fun is in the journey that you have with your selected nation as you guide them through this period of history. It is a big sandbox in which you can create a new history for your selected nation.

The music in EUIV is wonderful and the map is gorgeous. I must emphasise the high quality of the music, which is produced by Andreas Waldetoft (he has also produced excellent music for other Paradox games such as CKII and Victoria II). 

In short, EUIV is a fantastic strategy game. For anyone who likes Civ or other 4X style games, EUIV is definitely a game you should look at! If you enjoy games that make you think, require lots of strategy and that are heavy with complexity then EUIV is the right game for you.

Crashes on my machine are often enough to cause issues, since there is no autosave in this game. It tooks three attempts to make it through the tutorial without a crash, to even get to the first save point. After my 3rd time of losing 30-45 minutes of progress on a save, I decided to give up.

20721736,Freeman: Guerrilla Warfare,43450357,"Right, let's be real. This game is great, so what if the graphics are low quality and the optimization needs a bit of work, it's still a great game with so much potential.

Considering this game has been made by an indie dev team of 3 it really shows what can be done if the sole purpose of making a game isn't the amount of money you're going to make. It's a fun game with some good features and mechanics, yes it's in early access so it's not finished (clearly) and has some bugs here and there, which make the game a pleasure to play and discover what can be done and how to enjoy the game as it is. 

Admittedly this game does get rather stale after a few hours but depending on how you want to play and what you want your main goal to be whether it's to conquer all the towns or simply unite against a particular faction there is a lot of fun to be had in the game. 

The speed at which bug fixes and updates are being produced is also very impressive and another great reason why this game has as much potential as it has. Simply hating this game for not having 'enough' features and small things such as better scopes is not good enough and is just so needlessly picky.

SOOOOO if you're looking to buy this game then go for it, play for two hours, evaluate your experience and think to yourself 'Am I going to play this game for more than just a few more hours and is it right for me?'.

There are a few bugs and some things that I would love to see changed. A more active valve based reporting system for hackers for one. I was googline stuff about this and found many sites advertising the hacks they sell, this realy needs addressing. 

Active nodes instead of what the game has now, get rid of military grade craftables, C4 should be air drop only and they should only allow crafting of very crude weapons. The game also needs a better melee/skinning system.  I'm hoping they expand the map in the next two updates, or set like 3 different maps to play on and have them auto load so its not always the same thing.

I am super excited to see some of the changes I have read about and some of the things players have recomended in the forums.

Well worth 20 bucks, Enjoy!

Here is a quick summary of my thoughts:

Positive:
-Good story
-Great graphics
-Unique mechanics
-Dark nights
-Great combat system that takes time to learn and master
-Leveling system is a lot like oblivion 
-Interesting quests
-Perfect size of map 
-Very long game 

Negative:
-Music is absolutely terrible and ruins immersion (turned it off after a while)
-Rain looks horrible, barely any clouds, sunshowers most of the time which is ridiculous
-Fast travel is not fast in the least and waiting or sleeping takes forever... too much time spent looking at those screens
-UI is alright in art design but why go with listed items instead of a grid system...? very bad choice for a PC game
-still glitchy after all this time, although not all that bad in my experience
-zero use for money after you get a maxed out horse and armor. no player housing, no super expensive gear. nothing... money should be a lot harder to obtain

It's really unique and the game itself has a great concept. I look forward to playing the game in the future once they get some balancing and bugs worked out.

As it is the matchmaking is hardly playable. Any new players might as well not even bother spending any of your ingame currency at all because older and more regular players will literally walk up to you and one shot you without even taking a scratch. 

My brother and i duo'ed and the whole concept of the game is skewed by people who don't play the actual concept behind the game. It's literally older players playing the game just to kill new people and then do the objective so the match will end. By doing this they get massive amounts of exp from farming the enemies making it easy for them to acquire better gear, more perks, and more health.

If you want to test your luck your best bet is to hide in a house somewhere and hope a higher level player doesnt find you, because if he does all the work you put into your character is gone in an instant.

Like i said before. the concept is great but the matchmaking and balancing needs fixed big time because at the moment it is not enjoyable to play a game for 30 seconds, get picked off and have to sit in loading screens again. i'll say the loading screens are probably where i spent most of my time in this game. easily.

14662585,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,42843849,"So, bought this game last year in September or something.
It was pretty much nice those days, with it's gray colours game felt right unreal engine game. I played it once which was a whole new experience, then again then again, game kept changing it's course. It was pretty much fun. Met a lot of people, even made some friends from the same city.
But still game was incomplete, optimization sucks still, but for the sake of gameplay me and my friends kept playing this. While the game kept updating on weekly basis, it was nowhere near of optimizing gameplay. Not to mention the netcode and desyncs. I kept believing that they would make this game better, i used to play this game in high-ultra settings with 50-60 fps. Last i play this game(not recently) i couldn't get stable 60 fps on VERY LOW settings. Then i stopped playing this game, hoping to return to it in the future when they would get their heads out of their butts and fix this game.
But my nephew, 14 years old boi, played from my account and pc. So few days ago, he was playing. And ran up to me says they banned me. I was outraged, obviously my neph didn't knew how to cheat, teamkill or abuse to get perma-banned. I checked forums, bunch of people got banned because of their anti-cheat malfunction. 
In the end they unbanned me, but i highly doubt i would be ever returning to this game ever.
That's my 2 cents on this game, if you want to spend your money on this game, i would suggest spending it elsewhere, hell try free battle royale games.

P.S. Did i mention all the cheaters in the game, running around with aim hacks ?",1529424256,1529424256,False,3,0,0,True,False,76561198028369891,233,6,52762,0,25350

20998650,Just Cause 4,47390591,"put simply, this game is just boring and ugly. from the start it gets you into it with a cinematic cutscene, which looks horrid, as at the moment all character models and textures look quite odd. The game is sold off as lots to do in a populated world and wonders of creative genius to be discovered, when in truth all the youtube videos you`ve seen are literally all the good parts which are about an hour of fun. I really am starting to question why just cause is an ongoing franchise, as I really believed in this game all through development. Sadly I was disappointed beyond belief with the final result. The game feels rushed and clunky and when you play it feels like a movie you wished would just end already! I wish the team didn`t just rush this game and took a year or two more to make this into the game the just cause franchise really needed, to overhaul it all and make something refreshing from the ground up. If a 5th one comes out I don`t think I could get it as the hype to disappointment ratio is too tragic for me to possibly have to deal with again.

Pros: -New grapple hook adjustments such as boosters and balloons; these provide a couple hours of fun, unfortunately these are simply gadgets and don`t add to the immersion the world needs to have to feel complete.
-Some missions are fun and creative
-weather systems are fun, but are no ""game changer""

cons: -world is ugly, bland and rather boring after you`ve fiddled with the new gadgets and weather systems
- most missions are either missions to break out prisoners taken by the black hand, or to escort and protect someone when going from location a to b
-I`d somehow say this game is worse than JC3
-Ammo runs out too quickly, a whole army comes and youve got two clips of ammo in a gun, just give me a grapple and get rid of all guns if that`s how it`s going to be.
-The whole do wingsuit flight trials thing is back, Which makes me want avoid all of them as repeated game aspects just bore me, because I didn`t do enough in JC3?
-Cars just feel odd to handle, feels like im riding in a rocky speed boat that`ll either flip or drift out while im going a decent speed. In addition to this, the tire screech sound effects are ear piercing and annoying after 5 minutes.
-Bases in this game are there to get chaos so you can have more follows in your army, after you destroy a base, you can come back and all destructables respawn!?!? WHY!! It makes bases feel useless and just there for a quick shoot and go and no longer tie into progression.
In conclusion, I`ve probably never been quite this disappointed, have come home from a hard week of work hoping this will be my release and that the game would be as good as it was portrayed... unfortunately not and I feel like avalanche studios has lost their touch. I am going to get super smash bros ultimate so I can save my self from the sour taste of avalanches balls left in this consumers mouth. 
Hope this review was helpful in some way, I also know an update for JC4 will be out late december, but my hopes aren`t high as i think minor improvement to stabilizing the games current build and some graphical enhancement won`t change the actual feel of this fumbled, poorly thrown, ball of a game.",1544281190,1544281190,False,1,0,0,False,False,76561198226390200,53,2,419,0,207

17369496,DARK SOULS™ III,73865510,"first things first, having played sekiro i think that sekiro is better than this game in term of the combat but this game has the edge in world design and design in general. ill start with what i didnt like about this game. First is that some of the bosses arent too great, for example deacons of the deep or the disappointing yhorm fight. when i saw yhorm in the opening i thought he looked really cool but his fight is really easy with you being able to kill him in 4 or 5 hits from the stormbreaker. Another thing i didnt like was getting stuck in little crevices and not being able to get out. there were a couple occasions where i lost a hefty amount of souls because i got trapped in a corner or a divot in the wall and couldnt rolll out even though it looked like there was enough space to roll through. it wasnt too common but it shouldnt really happen more than once.

What i liked about the game was the general design. the weapons, the armours the enemies the bosses, all of them looked great. the environments also looked fantastic and finding the shortcuts that looped back to bonfires was really rewarding with everything having this interconnected feeling to it. Bonus point for an extrordinary soundtrack, a good soundtrack is one of my favourite things for a game to have. I cant say too much on the lore and all that because I never played dark souls 1 and I thought dark souls 2 was awful so I never got further than a few hours but seeing other people play this it looks like it has lots of nods back the the other games. 

The best three bosses in my opinion were the twin princes, the abyss watchers and the soul of cinder with the twin princes being my most favourite. Worst three bosses were the deacons of the deep, yhorm and crystal sage.

To provide some context for this review, I've never really gotten into previous Total War games, which might explain why I don't mind the supposed scaling back of diplomacy stuff. What strikes me most about this game however, is the difference between how the different races feels to play. I've now completed a large campaign with the empire - a playthrough that took me around 40 hours. I've gone on to play as the dwarf, which just feels so different both in combat and in the overworld stuff (better traders/ressourcer collectors, but worse (IMO) than the empire in combat).",1506444193,1506444193,True,3,0,0,False,False,76561198031710497,492,27,4037,0,3586

Incredible game! It's been a while since I've played a game that captivates me as much as this does.
It's an RTS, City Builder, Survival game and it's so nicely made. Really well thought out mechanics, buildings and units; Very nice progression, intuitive controls and beautiful art style!

It's also quite difficult (which I love)! I played on the easiest difficulty, died on my first playthrough by the hands of a single infected that managed to walk in and multiply... Second playthrough I only just won, the last wave took out most of my town but somehow I survived. 

The attacks really catch you off guard because most of the time there's only a few infected but then out of nowhere there's hundreds smashing down your walls!

Optimization
+Although optimization was horrid when it first came out, it has improved a lot, and is much easier to run. I get a good 60-100 FPS.

Combat
+Dinosaurs battling is just badass.
+Gun fights are pretty cool as well, though assault rifles are horrible underpowered.
-Melee combat is horrid. Better than ROG, sure, but still horrid. (This is not really the games fault, more the communities fault.)

Building
+You can build amazing looking structures, that work really well.
-Resources take ages to get (unless you are on an extra resources server, which is highly recommended)

Taming
+There is not just one approach to taming, which is great. There is the aggressive tame (which you need to do to most animals) which is knocking the creature out, and feeding it whilst keeping it knocked out with sedatives. Then, there is the taming approach that only a few creatures take, which is simply feeding them.

Everything I do in the game, including randomly killing monsters in villages feels important. The game is challenging, dwarfs Skyrim in volume, and side quests do not feel pointless.

My only gripes? Battle system has a pretty intense learning curve, but intuitive once you've practiced. Leveling seems a little skewed, feeling like it took me nearly forever to get to a spot where the quests in the second area were doable. 

All the gripes are moot if you're willing to invest time into knowing the abilities, learning the combat system, and be patient. Which I did. Which makes this a satisfyingly challenging RPG, which I have never said about any game in my life.

Would love to finish it but my immersion is totally broken by my constant frame drop. Did everything I could and I still can’t find a solution. This is probably one of my favorite games of all time if not for the technical issues. I haven’t beaten the game yet, so I can’t give definitive feedback on it. If you don’t encounter the errors I do the game is brilliant. So much freedom. 
Best parts of the game:
Amazing characters with big personality and development 
Quests are fun and rewarding 
Combat is versatile and the abilities are fun to use when you get a build going 
The right amount of challenge 
Ambiguity allows for multiple playthroughs without getting old. 
So much to discover and you are often rewarded for exploring everything. 
Incredible amount of customization
Room for roleplaying your own way

As long as you don't fear this game just screwing up due to technical issues I would 100% play this. Still super enjoyed my time in the game but am incredibly dissapointed that I cannot finish it in the way I would like to with immersion. This game really is all about immersion and the world feels so lived in. Hopefully one day I can finish it how it's meant to be played.

I like alot of the improvements in 2.0 in regards to the fleet management systems, new bombings and ground force attacks, the new edicts ect and how you need to use energy more to buy and do things. I like how they have improved space combat and tried to balance doom stacks. I personally however am not a big fan of the war and claims system. I like things to be somewhat realistic and find the claims and war system a big annoyance and not fun at all, to the point where i cbf even playing the game anymore as going to war is a must at some stage in the game. Achieving a total war win and getting your enemy to surrender to get all of your claimed territory is almost impossible with out completely destroying every fleet and conquoring every single planet the enemy has, and then after it you only get what you claimed too. Most of the time you get too much war exhastion and have to settle for a status quo where even the enemy you have dominated 98% of gets to enforce some of THEIR war claims on you too... Total bullshit, they just merged there war system from other paradox games into this one and it just doesnt work IMO. Also they took out differant FTL travel modes for ships so now you can only go down premade hyperlane routes which is total fucking BS its space FFS you should be able to go any where and come from any angle.

Over all not as enjoyable as it used to be. The war system is totally broken and takes alot of fun out of the game.

18355794,BATTLETECH,49168335,"BATTLETECH is a good game, but a bit poorly optimized, long loadings, for which I blame Unity.
Its a game with amazing potential, the camera allows great scenes and the Mech models are awesome, I like the story and all the customization, the mechbays and management part is great! All the art, voices acting and the menus are immersive and well thought.
The soundtrack in particular deserves huge praise!

What I would change:
I expected we could select all mechs and move as a RTS when OUT OF COMBAT, and then, re-start turns-mode on enemy contact. Even without enemies in sight we must click for every ""sprint"".
Also that the game used a point system where moving and firing X weapons would consume AP. I like the 'precision strike', though, its existence was not as clear as it should be and feels like lost opportunity.
The mechs are in constant (idle) Mech ""animations"" (mindless turning) are not great and Blackjack for example will lower its torso to run but not to aim/shoot its mounted ballistics, not game breaking at all but, could be improved. Some of those animations are quite slow but we can skip those scenes with SPACE, so that's good.

Conclusion:
The first hours in this game are 'old school hard' trying to not go bankrupt while making several silly mistakes but it's really good! Overall it's a great game that I will always feel that would have been better, had it not been made with Unity. Despite this, it is very recommended, it's addictive and well thought with good enough AI (normal).",1550896979,1582671652,True,1,0,0,False,False,76561197992806152,1755,112,3905,0,162

19593893,Deep Rock Galactic,81645269,"Apparently I have not written a review for this game yet.

ROCK AND STONE YYEEEAAAAHHH pretty much sums it up. ""How?"" do you ask?

You see, this game has a very unique community in that there is a sense of brotherhood between all players. It is not the usual toxic-fit-fest you see in other multiplayer games. This single phrase is activated by pressing a keybind, where your dwarf then raises his pickaxe in the air and chants ""ROCK AND STONE"". Or a variant of--there are many different forms of ROCK AND STONE.

There are also other elements that also create a sense of home for you, your friends, and even random strangers. For example, this may be one of the few games in existence to have within itself it's very own drinking culture. There is a bar in the space rig(your home between missions), where you can drink specials that give you boons during missions, drink novelty drinks with...curious effects, or just get blackout drunk. There is also a jukebox to play random music, and a barrel kicking games. Barrels also have their own sub-culture as well...

But if a good community bound together by common values of ROCK AND STONE aren't enough for you, what else does this game have to offer for you?

I don't know about you, but I nominated this game for the 2020 ""Outstanding Visual Style"" award. Not only do I find the game simply gorgeous, from throwing flares that bound about and light refracts about the cave as well, to just the general art direction--I'm pretty sure the lowpoly art style also makes performance far better than most games; and I'm not sure the lighting system this game has would run well with a more ""realistic"" title.

There's also just plain good music, even if you ignore the ambiance type tracks, the jukebox has several absolute BANGERS. There's something for everyone. ""Hidden Gems"" indeed.

As for gameplay, the solo is just as great as the 4-stack co-op. With single player, you get a controllable robot that packs it's own punch; just as much so as it can help you mine...Although good luck with Hazard 5 missions solo...The gunplay and swarm control are just as satisfying as calmly and quietly mining in piece--and ah! The glory of finding compressed gold and other hidden goodies.

The replayability in this game is neigh seemingly endless, not only is each mission map a randomized generated cave system, you have different guns, different gun upgrades/overclocks, different perks, different customizations, different mission types, different difficulties, different mission modifiers, different weekly deep dives for those promoted--did I mention you can ""promote"" your character to gain access to even more content? Or did I mention you can find secrets in missions beyond ""compressed gold""?

...I don't know what else to say, not only am I probably missing something, there's just so much to miss talking about! The devil is in the details. Because there is just so much love put into this game. There's just something to it that makes it a pure gem in it's own right. The devs are also great, and listen to the player base! For example, there was a random meme made about the game where a dwarf said ""IF YOU DON'T ROCK AND STONE, YOU AIN'T COMING HOME!""...and it got added as a voice line in the game when you ROCK AND STONE.

I'm also just making a very long review, and kinda need to stop myself here. So, a couple other details: Great with friends, great fun, buy it now!

11459872,The Room,48399499,"The Room is a game that gives you that rarest and most-satisfying of rewards for your progress- it makes you feel [i]smart.[/i] Testing your observation, reasoning, deduction, learning and lateral thinking skills in a number of different ways, being able to beat The Room (without having to resort to a guide) is incredibly satisfying. The puzzles are challenging (and I admit there [i]were[/i] precisely two points where I needed to resort to a guide- the first a result of careless oversight, which taught me a lesson about double checking [i]everything,[/i] the second was genuine difficulty in picking up the connection between two apparently unconnected puzzles), but it's a GOOD kind of challenging. Once you accept that almost anything can happen with the magic puzzle boxes you're presented with, your mind will hopefully expand enough to encompass all the possibilities.

While a story isn't really necessary (just ""solve the puzzles"" would be quite adequate), the game provides a highly interesting one anyway. From what I can tell, your friend who recently disappeared invited you to his manor to bestow upon you a treasure he'd discovered, which is contained with a series of elaborate, gorgeously-ornamented vaults. The eerie atmosphere grows denser as you uncover hints of the nature of your friend's unearthly discovery, and your curiosity eventually takes you to places you might not wish you'd gone to. For a game with no NPCs and no ability to move beyond rotating the camera around the vaults, it really does feel like a horror game. The aesthetics are also top-notch, from the beautifully-crafted puzzle boxes to the atmospheric sound effects and occasional music.

For such a short and ultimately simplistic game, The Room is a triumph of video gaming. Aesthetically beautiful, narratively engaging and providing excellent gameplay challenge, it's a must-play for anyone who considers themselves to be a [i]smart[/i] gamer, rather than just one with good twitch reflexes.

3142329,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,26424050,"I am really loving this game. Only a few hours into the campaign today, and I can't wait to see it someday in a VR version. It is the most impressive game I have ever seen. 

This game is for you if:
- You like great immersive and epic storylines, at the price of more linearity on it
- You love space themes (Wing Commander comes to mind as the closest) and can play a game that is not a simulator but an action/FPS fun game.
- You have a good machine and high end graphics card that can pull the tremendously detailed and beautifully made graphics -I suppose some of the hate comes from lower end ranges, I found it a bit too demanding, but that is the price of the amazing content.

I have enjoyed the combat more than in other similar games (Gears of War 4, Mass Effect, etc). I found the story far more engaging than the games mentioned, though do not expect an RPG on this game or a simulator. It is mostly action/FPS even when flying, but how fun! Become the captain of one of the two last Earth capital ships and live the epic confrontations to save the planet from extinction -I will try not to spoil anything and stop there :). 

It also has a lot of the elements that were first seen in Star Citizen, though knowing that this is not a flying / space simulator. The physics and ship controls are geared towards ease of use and fun rather than precision and complexity. That said, I do like simulators, and still can love this approach.

Curious fact that I have not seen mentioned anywhere yet... when boarding an enemy ship for the first time, there is a side corridor with the paint ""Waste Disposal 42"". Uh? I think I know what they mean, and though I am looking forward to the game they seem to refer to, I can see that it has the bar 3 times as high now after this game...

 I suppose that the other hate wave may come for the same reason I did not buy any previous COD game -it may or actually does feel like a different theme completely -and in a sense it is. It is not a classic military game, it is a futuristic military game. And what the hell, I love it!",1478296737,1478296973,True,1,0,0,True,False,76561197967939437,407,3,1521,0,366

- Voice coms didn't work until we switched to beta
- Tools description only tells you what they do, but now how or what are the range, controls etc
- Some inconsistency (or bugs?) in the mechanics that can be pretty frustrating, especially regarding the crucifix
- the visuals of the ghosts needs some extra work

Pros:

[*]Everything relating to theme and story is amazing.
[*]Even the gameplay is tied to the plot.
[*]Good music.
[*]Everything.
[/list]

Cons (I mean I guess I'll try):
[list]
[*]This game at times borders on stressful, but that isn't actually a con becuase it's a result of it being so compelling.
[*]I mean I guess you could say the combat is simple but that's becuase it isn't really meant to be like standard turn-based, and is instead focused on facilitating an alternate gameplay mechanic. So again not really a con.
[*]This game has no real flaws

     I did not like that my lovely TES: Skyrim has these monsters everywhere... There are so many people who want something from me...
     But wait! This is an MMO genre game. And out of all games of that genre I played this one is my favourite. It includes tons of things to do, to collect, to research and so on. You can pick any of your favourite classes! Don't want to fight that much? You can go all-in into crafting. You can join guilds. Well.. Not only those made by players.. But there exist such guilds as Fighters guild, Thieves' guild, etc. DLC give you lots of quality content. Some of them provide more of locations. Some of them provide more things to do if you want to be a thief. Anyway, all of them are really good.
     You don't have to spend lots of money into the game once you buy it. There is a store for those who want to donate, but you can play without it easily.
     Anyway, this game has lots of stuff to interest you with. Give it a try! Better do it with friends :D

    UPD: Updating the review a few years later. This game has too many paid DLCs now. If you want to get the full experience, you'll have to pay a lot. Also, I realized that the game's becoming more and more tidious and boring with time.

10528100,The Walking Dead,8968758,"This is a tough one to review. Normally I hate the reviewer who carries on about bad graphics, and its been many years since I had the time for adventure games.

However, I've now played through the entire Season 1 after getting hooked. I bought the game on a steam sale due to being a big fan of the TV show and comics, as well as it's overwhelming positive reviews.  When I first tried the game however, I wondered if I had bought some knock-off B-grade title as this couldn't possibly be the game everyone was talking about. Not only are the graphics poor, the game mechanics (character movement, etc) remind me of the original ""Alone In The Dark"" PC game during the mid 1990s.

After giving it more time I realized (like I often retort in negative reviews) that I should assess the game on its other (gameplay) merits and not just the superficial stuff.  By the end of the game I was more attached to the story of this game than that of the TV series, and was equally affected as I was with ""The Last Of Us"".

How do I summarise my recommendation then? Considering the price, especially on sale, this is a must have game for anyone who has even a modest interest in The Walking Dead, adventure games, or strong story-driven gaming.

Pros: 
* Voice acting surprisingly good (perhaps with the exception of the child protagonist)
* Strong story consistent with The Walking Dead world
* Player decisions give you a real feeling of consequence
* Season/Chapter based game structure makes it a game that's likely to keep on giving.
* Decent replay value due to the player decisions.

Cons:
* Possibly below average graphics for the genre
* I'd have liked the game to encourage exploration a little more, or make puzzle solving less superficial.
* Player decisions aren't always as substantial as they might seem in the long term.",1391477868,1391477868,True,1,0,0,True,False,76561198003013082,461,6,930,0,624

1st. SinglePlayer. I actually life Sci-fi themed games, so this COD has a decent ~9 hour long campaign, It's a classic COD Hollywood style, With over the top story, explosion etc, now minus the story of invasion that doesn't make sense and that all SDF are speaking with heavy Russian accent and that entire society SDF was made as brainless killing machine society (they really wanted you to kill without feeling quilty), with zero regards of their own human life (Which is huge b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t). The story is fine, not too good, not too bad, like average COD b.u.l.l.s.h.i.t., I do like how you can customize your loadout before the mission and that you have space dog-fight missions, that's a good stuff. 7/10

2nd. Multiplayer. I am not a fan of CoD MP, players jumping all around like kengurs, weapons without recoil, players who non stop sprint around the map and kill you with knife, not to mention opponet is running into you, you shoot him with your ASSAULT RIFLE and he takes all of those bullets and kills you with one single knife swing, For Fock Sakes... 5/10

3rd. Zombies. You get a ONE, a 1 single map for zombies, only one map unless you buy DLCs for more maps, 4 in total. The one that you get is 80s themed park... Activions trully decided to take a dump on their players and make fools out of them. 2/10

FInal score 4.7/10 . What a joke of the game, I got it as a package of CoD MWR for which I payed 30€. CoD MWR is a far better game overall, only minus is, it doesn't not have zombies, then again neither does IW.",1503258213,1503258518,False,1,0,0,False,False,76561198133683348,168,123,635,0,635

10557497,Divinity: Original Sin 2,73478595,"I always loved RPGs, but was always skeptical of turn-based games, as they never really fit well with me.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 COMPLETELY changed that for me. This is easily one of my favorite games of all time, ever, period, no questions asked. The absolutely astounding amount of content in this game is just breathtaking. This isn't your typical ""make a powerful character and bonk everything completely unchallenged"". Every quest, every encounter, every event has many different outcomes, and many different ways of approaching it. Run into 3 undead enemies using poison surfaces to heal themselves? A quick fireball / fire arrow / exploding barrel will ignite all of the poison surfaces, burning them to death. Lots of enemies close together? Wet them all with a Rain spell, destroy their Magic Armour, and cast lightning to shock and stun all of them, forcing them to miss their turn.

The writing and character development is really on point. Every character has depth to them, they aren't just shallow NPCs. The quests are all unique, it's not some simple ""go get me this, bring it back. Go kill 5 things, come back"". The quests are all designed with lore and story to them, so you don't feel like you're just doing fetch missions, being told exactly what to do and how to do it. Cursed chest that you can't open? Maybe not yet...until you unlock some of your potential powers and can backtrack to open that super cool chest.

Want to be a good sourceror, benevolent in all facets and your only goal is to help and save the people? Go for it. Evil, vindictive psychopathic traitor hell-bent on causing destruction and chaos? Go for it. Want to just be ridiculous with your friends and turn enemies into chickens and do all kinds of weird things to help win fights / solve puzzles? Go for it. It's all there for you.

I believe the modding community needs to be mentioned as well -- particularly the class modders. Odinblade and Helaene (I think I spelled that correctly) introduced MANY different new skills and classes to the game, which make it an absolute blast to play through again with.

Really haven't seen a bit of  software behave this badly out of the box since the 1990's.
I cant comment on the game it did run now it wont run......

When it gets fixed I be back.

So they issued a patch and I have managed to get ten hours in with Death Stranding.

First and foremost, game play is everything. I have been playing computer games ever since I got a VIC-20 so that a year short of for years, I think. The same old concept wrapped up in new cloths is pushed out the door more and more often. It all seems to be about extracting as much money from you as possible these days. One you have been there a refresh version of a first-person shooter is just another me too. I tend to buy one or two games a year This year I bought Alyx and I got Death Stranding as a gift with a new graphics card. I knew nothing and  I had no idea about this game until I played it. 

I must admit that I struggled with the first few hours ""what this all about?"" and when I had to lob a few grenades at BT my eyes rolled. Then it stopped working. I lost interest. But when a patch came out, I was more curious if it was fixed that picking up where I left off. I have been in the computer industry for thirty years so problems like this keep me curious. So, playing some more a few things started to fall into place with the game play but honestly if it wasn’t for the story, I think I would have just left it. Working out how to deal with mules, identifying routes and problem-solving access to some locations got me engaged in the game I enjoy problem solving. The graphics are impressive and in truth the game just loose so much of its atmosphere without it. The game play is slow because there is decision making involved and this for me is the winning ticket. Its engaging. For me all the best games I have played have had this I have seen a lot but in short Pirate Adventure on the VIC20, Elite on a Acorn Electron, .... MS Flight sim.. Half-life... . Alyx..  

So if you like a slower passed game that will engage you with a strong story line that’s also great to look at Death Stranding is a good choice. I don’t know if its worth the cost it was free to me. But it something you can dip into and out off unlike so many other running, jumping shooting games where you have to constantly practice. I hope this game doesn’t fall into that category as it progresses or at least maintains a degree of option when it comes to such scenarios.

I just wish it hadn’t messed up so badly when I first started using it this can leave a bad taste that sometime never goes away.

It's Realistic, you need to eat & sleep, can't heal yourself during a battle which means you have to come prepared.

Combat does take some getting used to, it is not a big learning curve but enough to where you need to know what your doing.

This is a big shame as first two are in another league to this, as usual a different company made this to the first and it shows. Replications and copies from them and decision made, which I felt were generally bad decisions andf had a negative effect instead of a step forward.
8/10
The first two in my view, are as close to perfection a game can get. 2 Has better gameplay than the first, but the the first makes up for a better story. Neither of them have bugs or annoying parts made about the story or gameplay.

IF YOU ABOUT TO BUY THIS, BUY THE FIRST TWO INSTEAD! BOTH 11/10, Favourite games.

Finally the expansion packs: after playing them i was glad the new developers/designers didnt go back to rapture (for the full game) as they would not have done it justice. The first scene I love; seeing rapture in its glory and the buildings and sea life. But later and it chapter two it trys to change the character and history of rapture and so the story doesnt make sense in relation to the original rapture set games.

The story was pretty good, I didn't want to step aside and to the optional missions and tombs because I really wanted to find out how it would end.

Since they made the game easier to change your skills out and made it streamline its fun with friends. Solo play is still viable now with the AI rework. Basically easy to play, and hard to master.

12776346,Grand Theft Auto V,83003264,"Psychopath simulator. Kill people, get money, you know the deal bruh it's a GTA.
It's a modern gaming classic and you should definitely play it!

> The story is cool, involving 3 criminals with very distinct personalities and interesting chemistry. Game starts with a failed robbery attempt in which 2 of the bad guys end up dead. But actually the main criminal (Michael) had faked his death to escape, aided by a corrupt government agent. The agent rose through the ranks by allegedly taking down this big fish, and Michael got to live in freedom enjoying his wealth.
Many years down the road, Michael ends up meeting with the surviving gang member (Trevor) who is a VERY emotionally unstable man (a goddamn psychopath to be honest) and has mixed feelings towards his best friend who he thought was dead but is now standing in front of him. Michael wants to return to the criminal activities and helps a guy named Franklin get into shady business for big money. You can play as Michael, Trevor and Franklin, bringing chaos and destruction to the world for your own selfish benefits.

> The story and environment has comedic and satirical touches. There are many references to real life brands and parodies to social networks, which I find cool. It's like mocking the modern hipster life and flat earthers, anti-vaxxers, those kinds of people.  

> Online mode is full of cheaters and takes too long to load even when installed in a SSD. Otherwise the co-op Heists and the many different game modes are fun. You can buy vehicles and real estate. Recently a casino was included. Random events occur in the public lobby. You can put a price on your friends head so other players will try to kill them. It's fun

It's a fun game to play, and it has a lot to offer, just not as much as 3 when it comes to exploration options and random silly shenanigans. Personally, I think some of that is limited because of the devs choice to add a voice to the main character, but it actually didn't end up as bad as I thought it would.
The best part of 4 is probably the story and dlc. It's interesting enough to keep playing till the end, and both dlc were unique and lengthy. Though there's no karma aspect in the game, there are options of a few factions to choose between near the end which was awesome. The only part of 4 that has let me down is the hefty amount of time spent playing village leader to a bunch of completely inept settlers. When Todd Howard said that there were 400+ hours of game play, I didn't think that a solid 250 of those hours would be spent rescuing, building beds and assigning positions to said settlers. But I digress. 
Overall the game is certainly worth a play or two, but I would suggest playing on survival and enabling console commands just for the sake of not pulling your hair out when the inevitable glitched quest comes along.",1606787282,1606787282,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198106925464,101,1,61058,755,60087

12076579,Age of Empires II (2013),31406126,"1 – GENERAL

Age of Empires II HD it's a remastered version of the original isometric RTS game that we spend a ton of time playing when we were small brats!

The graphics had a little boost but the game remains more or less the same. You have those nostalgic sounds and soundtrack, and even the same menus. Those menus are already dated with a lot of options lacking that could improve the game a lot but do not forget, we are here for the nostalgia...

You can chose one of several civilizations to play with, customize the map and go, or you can choose some of the available historical missions to play.

Multiplayer is alive and kicking, and that was the first time I've experienced it. I've sucked!

2 – GAMEPLAY

Age of Empires it's still a great game. The AI always had some issues, and now it still has. For the core players this will be a easy and exploitable game, but it gives some illusion of depth for the casual gamer. Either way it's very fun to play, it's fun to try to find the perfect balance between resources and armies, try to boost economy, and crush all the opponents.

The replay value is immense. You can customize each map, you have the missions and the multiplayer. Even the tutorial is interesting.

Overall it's still a very actual game.

3 – CONCLUSION

I have some issues with the game. OFC I'll recommend it, the game it's great, but it seems a lazy remake, since a lot of stuff could easily be improved, menus could be updated without losing the classic feeling of the game. But now it very easy to find this game almost for free so, I do not care with nothing of that stuff. Just buy it and have fun!

15795348,The Elder Scrolls Online,13852579,"I played Ultima Online , Dark Age of Camelot , Warhammer Online and Eve for long term MMO's , I've dabbled in a few other MMO's short term. This game comes in the top 5 MMO's I've touched . ESO has a non locking , 3D action based combat system which is refreshing compared to most mmo's . The crafting will not touch games like ArcheAge but there is more than enough to keep crafters happy. I'm more into open field RVR , ESO has a very Guild Wars type open RVR. The best I've played since Dark Age of Camelot ! They have 3 sides !!!! So far my main hero is almost level 33 , I've yet to see the vet PVP area but even the ""baby"" non vet pvp zone is a blast . You setup catapults , knock down walls , seige castles , gank enemies ... all the fun you want from a open PVP zone. So far they only have one RVR zone but it's broken down into vet ( 50 + heros ) and non vet servers . All player stats are boosted up to level 50 in non vet pvp zones .

Most bad reviews come from people who say the game won't have enough immersion. If you want the level of immersion in Skyrim , don't buy this . It's a MMO . MMO's are YEARS away from making a PVE game on the level of Skyrim ... won't happen, stay away . That being said . This game has some of the best PVE in any MMO I've touched. The basic quest are  interesting and well done compared to pretty much every other MMO. They make the level ""grind"" pretty easy to deal with , plus the level grind is pretty fast compared to a lot of fantasy MMO's of the past . Again , maybe that's my age showing. If you pick up a sword and shield , you level that tree line . Fire a bow , you're leveling bow . Just like the single player game. Classes are VERY diverse and open .

Warnings: 
-The game will drop you in a map and tell you nothing. (If you're a fan of build/fight games you'll figure it out...eventually)
-Put your character on softcore there are no benefits others than constant frustration from playing medium or hard.
-Start with a small map, Large is really, honestly, Freaking large
-Have a backup map for extra mining and fishing once you got the hang of it that stays out of hardmode
-Try every weapon to know what's better for your fighting style, because eventually bosses live up to their damn names
-Save some plants and random crap in a chest somewhere for late game play

Positives:
-I mean...I can't stop playing it even though it makes me rage sometimes so...you know...buy it and have fun.

The community is toxic -- part of which is the nature of the squeaker and there are also a collection of trolls with remarkable skills.  I'm not really concerned with that.  You'll eventually find people that remind you that maturity still exists and ultimately there is endless fun to be had in this game.

What makes this game is that you take FPS, add in some melee, some armor (or nakedness),  the ability to harvest and create and sooner or later this leads to *death really matters* moments.  Add in some great sounds for interaction and ambience and the next thing you know you're fully immersed and losing track of time.

I think the crafting and base building is awesome and some of the best moments are making it back to base w/a few more materials to shore up defenses or get some raid gear together.

5858397,Stardew Valley,21519690,"I've spent a few hours playing this now. I wil probably update this review once I spend a little longer on it. So far though it's like playing a Harvest Moon game but with the irritating elements cut out of it. So if you enjoy games like that you will enjoy this. 

The basic plot of the game is as follows you basically inherit your Grandfathers farm, and move there to run it. When you first arrive the farm buildings are dilapidated, and the land is completely over-run with wild grass and stones. Over the course of a few years, you will plant seeds, and later bring in livestock. At the same time you can also be interacting with the people (maybe romancing them and eventually marrying them) who live in the nearby town, and making improvements there. 

Improvements I really liked in this one over Harvest Moon games I have played.
You start with most of the tools rather than have to wait for the game to give you them. Things like the scythe in their basic form will cut multiple pieces of grass right from the start. There is an indicator you can turn on so you can see precisely what square you will be hitting/watering/mining.
The pace you earn money seems just right, whereas some of the Harvest Moon games could be far too grindy.
There are quite a lot of different seeds to plant for each season.
You can do same-sex marriages if you wish, with potential adoption of a child later. It's good to have that option there for those who want it.
There is a Crafting system.
You can level by spending time doing things. There are a few talent choices to specialise later on (e.g. become better at working the land vs better at animal husbandry. Each level gives you new recipes for crafting/cooking, as well as other perks.

My only criticism is that I wasn't a huge fan of the sprites the towns people used. The female characters didn't look any different from the men bar obvious things like facial hair and the clothing they wear. I'm finding I'm not remembering who is who yet, possibly as they don't look distinctively different or seem different personality wise.

Lots of walking, but not in a bad way.

Good gunplay once you begin to understand it. Frustrating at first. Lots of nuance.

I would pay 35 dollars to play it.

Update:
One major flaw to the integral design of this game is the punishing aspect of character loss. There is really no way to get attached to a hunter you like or think looks cool because they are doomed to die at some point (usually within 3-5 games) unless you drastically alter your playstyle and cower in fear at the thought of death. 

Though this was the developer's artistic vision for the game, it leads to an experience that makes you recruit characters having no care for them as you know you'll lose them. Totally ruins any feeling of immersion in the world.

In a redeeming way it lets you play the game not caring about survival and lets you make some cool plays.",1590466056,1590893787,True,1,0,0,True,False,76561198063089365,225,47,9118,0,2972

What amazes me is that any Dev in there right mind would favor these poor possibly mentally retarded players over the honest player base.  I don't know maybe im missing something but if this truly is Devs banning people for watching publicaly open content then these Devs are also probably mentally retarded which says alot about all these crap games being released on the Unreal 4 engine.  I long for the days where you paid money to skilled people that designed an engine around a game and a concept.

Darkest Dungeon places you at the head of an estate that has been desecrated by an evil presence, and it's your job to return it to its former glory. To do this, you must recruit heroes, arm them, and send them into the depths of your family home to root out and destroy the otherworldly creatures that have been unleashed by your late father.

As your heroes explore the depths of the surrounding area, numerous events and encounters will injure your heroes both mentally and physically. When a hero is pushed to their limits, they may rise to the occassion or succumb to the stress. Much like any rogue-like, heroes that succumb to their wounds perish never to return; Their names line the graves stones in the cemetary of your estate. Those that survive live on with the scars of their previous encounter.

Your ability to strategize and cope with the onslaught of these terrible events will determine your success. Do you take the risk and push on just a bit further to turn the ruined excursion into a glorious success? or do you cut your losses now and return to the estate to lick your wounds and ponder what could have been done better?

There are three large areas of the map to explore and the setting is spot on. I will have to admit Farcry 3's villians were the best....Honestly the acting in 5 is pretty damn good as well though. Only thing is Farcry 5 is a bit comedic far as characters go ...then the next minute its serious ....Its a little bit odd at times but nothing enough to ruin the experience.
Also the perks are a welcome addition to the game adding in new abilities to larger inventory bags more ammo wind suits andso on.
Graphically running on ultra at 2560x1440 16gb GTX 1080 averaging 70 to 90 fps. Game is very well optimized and looks very good.
Another thing I forgot to mention is oddly you can actually choose you're own appearance male or female...clothes gear.
Comes with Arcade for creating maps very nice extra. I've spent around 8 hours in the PC version and I'm having a blast.
There are enough changes to make it feel fresh and enough left alone to keep it Farcry and IMO best FarCry since 3....I was'nt a huge fan of 4 since it was basically a huge expansion of 3.

I have over 200 hours on the game and I do recommend getting this game it has its upsides and its downsides. There a a few things that Ubisoft can do to improve the game like for example they could improve some characters. This game can get repetitive and boring if played too much and is better if played with friends.

-Wide variety of weapons with each providing a distinct feel
- Sense of progression and customization from loot/trees/classes
-Different special enemies with unique attacks
- Interesting dialogue between characters 
-Grimoires and tomes provide a nice secondary objective for parties which are worth going for (bonus loot+exp!)
-Beautiful graphics
Cons:
-Bugs and Glitches everywhere (I've fallen off the map or into the floor more than 6 times in 13 hours)
- Game frequently crashing (especially frustrating near the end of the level and you lose all progress/rewards)
-Even upon reaching the end of a level and getting into the bubble, if the host DC's you lose EVERYTHING. (reconnecting to a new host sends you to the beginning of the level!)
-The ability for parties to kick members and in turn that member losing all rewards (more common than one might think, especially with premade parties and elitists)

Overall I have somewhat enjoyed the game, but it fails to live up to the experience I was expecting from trailers/gameplay previews due to the crippling bugs and glitches that makes every 1/3 lobby unplayable. You WILL be robbed of progress whether it be drops or exp until these things are fixed and because of that I cannot recommend this game.

I had an xbox and I played this, completed the campaign, and was almost level 100 online (not sure of my exact level before I made the switch to PC). I got this on pc hoping for a similar if not the same experience I had on xbox. The campaign is still incredible and just as good as i remembered it. Incredibly memorable characters and incredibly fun main missions and a never ending supply of (but never boring) side missions. So yes, the campaign is still great, but then comes the multiplayer.

The multiplayer IS fun, it has a ton of content and is my favorite part of the game. But oh my GOD does it have problems!!! There will most likely be a hacker in every lobby who if you are lucky enough won't kill you non-stop with explosions from across the map. Also after a couple of hours of playing the controls just break. Every button will tab me out of the game and I have to close it and then wait the VERY LONG loading screens to get back into a lobby, most likely infected by the scum of the community, hackers. I cannot tell you all enough how good of a game this was on my Xbox One X, looked incredible, and everything ran smooth. But on PC i feel like I have plugged my keyboard and mouse into a damn potato. It does not feel optimized and it is super annoying being griefed by hackers and the control bugging out forcing me to restart it. Also, a side not, whenever I click my windows key to go to my actual desktop it just glitches discord for about 10 seconds and I can't access it until the glitch stops. That part is the least worst part but barely compares to everything else in multiplayer. For 30$, the campaign is incredible, there is SOO much to do, but the multiplayer just feels like a mess and PLEASE ROCKSTAR WORK ON YOUR DAMN ANTI-CHEAT!!!!!!!!",1588995475,1588995475,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198726488414,31,5,3038,1879,791

Frankly, I hate the MMO-ification that's been a hot trend of late, like certain games that added this crap where it wasn't needed.  So I'm intruiged at a game that takes the MMO tropes that are baked into the very genre, and minimalizes them. 

I'm not keen on the endless treadmill of Make Numbers Bigger, so MMOs have left me cold.  This game breaks your gameplay down into manageable chunks, an arc of equipment progression that's tied to each province, capped with recovering that province's legendary artifacts for modest, permanent convenience bonuses.  Yeah, you start over in a new province.  Go back to the old one and you can slap your old kit on and roflstomp stuff if you want.

Frankly, I like this.  It means each new province is a fresh new adventure where you need to use cunning and guile to avoid getting crushed, and it means each new province is just as accessible to your buddy who just started playing, as it was for you with 600+ hours in the game. 

You may not agree.  Perhaps the rush of ever-increasing your numbers is what does it for you.  There are doubtless thousands of games that can cater to that urge and I wish you all the happiness in playing them.  This one is closer to what I like.  It's worth the asking price if you have friends to play it with.",1569869324,1569869324,True,4,0,0,False,False,76561197993329136,403,74,4382,0,1737

14828458,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,39950013,"PUBG is a fun game, despite its numerous flaws, but I am not the one who can overlook all of the jarring flaws that this ""finished"" game is riddled with.

The biggest problem is the fact that the netcode is a product of thousands monkeys flinging shit at keyboards. The servers are most likely Pentium 2 machines running on 400 MHz or maybe Athlons on 500 MHz, because I can't fathom another reason why the rubber banding problem is so prevalent. If I had 10 cents for each time it took me 5 seconds to pick up a weapon, I would be able to purchase proper servers for the game. Basically, the game is laggy, to say the least.

The second biggest problem is the cancer that is ruining video games - loot boxes. Fuck any company that exploits those with addictive personalities by introducing them to gambling, so fuck you Bluehole, you greedy turd nuggets. Earning tons of money is not enough, you need ALL the money, right? Gambling mechanics in video games are the worst invention that has graced the world of video games, and Bluehole shows us that they are not immune to greed, shame on you Bluehole!

The third problem is the number of cheaters, and the fact that the game has slowly turned me into a Chinese-hating xenophobe who can't listen to Yuja Wang without thinking that she might be cheating in PUBG as well. So, eat a bowl of tiny chodes Bluehole, because we all know who purchases skins farmed by Chinese cheaters, and hence we know why you don't want to limit Chinese players from playing on EU and USA servers.

There are plenty more problems like poor sound quality that still manages to make my ears bleed at certain times, the art style of the Erangel map is atrocious - the developers suck at using pre-bought assets, and more, but I don't have the time required to do a full review of this gambling simulator facading as a battle royale game.

In the end, PUBG could have been a great game, but, at this moment, it is an overhyped money-printing machine that has  overstayed its welcome. I am looking forward to more companies jumping on the Battle Royale hype-train and creating a product that is actually worth my time and money.

I am sad because PUBG is a game with a lot of squandered potential, but there are other great games out there, so I don't recommend anyone wasting their time and money on this feces festival.

Pros:
- Can be fun at times if you play with the right people. (The people are what makes the game fun, not the game itself.)

Cons:
- Optimization problems.
- Shoddy ingame assets and pre-bought assets that break the immersion.
- Awful servers.
- Rampant cheaters.
- Gambling mechanics.

The maps were really small for what is being worked with, or a lot of the essential buildings are huge and take up way too much space, making it seem small. Working on a smaller scale would make it seem bigger.

This game is fantastic. Graphics are a bit dated, but the gameplay is more alive feeling than FO3NV, the colors are much brighter and less depressing than FO3NV, and the core aiming mechanics seem to function much better, i personally have ignored VATS because i can get more consistent shots than it can, no matter the range.

The incentive to win games to secure elo, rather than having a good overall performance in the game is one of the reasons so many people call this community ""toxic"". There is very limited fun to be had in this game unless you have a 5 man party to play with at all times. 

You can get 15-20 kills per match and be ranked a bronze or silver if your team is not as competent as the enemy team, thats why people from diamond rank can easily drop to copper rank and kick the asses of new players for easy renown and alpha packs. The ranking elo system in this game is just completey broken and unfair.

Imagine playing a fighting game where the top players can easily drop down to lower ranks for extra in-game currency and rewards. It would be as horrible as it sounds and thats how bad the matchmaking is in this game.

The only thing wrong with this game (besides the dev's SJW leanings) is the matchmaking system, and thats enough for me to give this game a negative review.

From that moment all other games went on a back burner and we was hooked. We avoided reviews and help video's and went all in it took days to complete the game on normal and we could have took longer as we never did everthing on the To-Do list. The game is so well made and thought out i would not have bitched paying a dayz price for it. We liked the game so much we are doing something we have never done before and that is replay the game in hard mode and try and complete everything.

21085135,Europa Universalis IV,67731630,"Pro:
Very deep 4x, and for someone like me, it has a surprisingly large amount of lore.  Some call it 'history', but whatever.
Allows immense amounts of variation in the game without modification.  
Replayable to an extreme.  I'm well over 1,000 hours played and still trying out new things.

Neutral:
There's always something to learn.  That's both exciting and intimidating, as the game is very detailed.
The game changes with updates.  Strategies, what you've learned up until now, and what you've enjoyed or disliked may all change.  From one major update to the next, the game can feel and play very differently.
It's addicting.  

Con:
It's a game that requires you to jump in and try everything out, and fail, then repeat, and repeat again, before you get the hang of it.
You have to decide upfront if you want to enable achievements or not upfront, and achievements are only allowed on Ironman.  Granted, the game could be 'cheesed' so easily without this requirement, but the requirement is very strict and allows for little to no mistakes.
Some parts of the game can be crippling, but aren't something you'd know until you got there.  I recently sunk 60 hours into a game only to find game mechanics were built to cripple my methods.  It wasn't an AI getting clever, or a misplay - simply a mechanic that pops up and says ""well, that method won't work anymore.  You'll have to restart if you want to enjoy the game again.""

Pros: You get to pick a side (killer or survivor) and if you pick survivor you can play with your friends. There is a custom game option if you wanna kill and get killed by your friends! It is really entertaining and even though its gamestyle seems limitted to what you can do during a game, you can always try new gamestyles, a huge variety of perk combinations and characters to play that it will hardly ever get boring and if it does get boring it will be around the time a new dlc will be realeased which can be translated to new more stuff to try out! ^_^

Cons: It can be a little bit buggy which can be extremely irritating escpecially because you lose games while you are trying to rank up. Some survivors end up working with the killer against the other survivors in order to earn more bloodpoints(in game currency), or rage quit easily abandoning their team.

Overall besides the situational troll you are gonna get  (which can happen in every only game) if you like working with team and escaping, or if you like the thrill of hunt then this is a game you should definately try out. 
I would recommend to get your buddies to try it out all together and have lan parties playing it! It really rocks!!",1517362654,1517363982,True,1,0,0,False,False,76561198314155890,126,8,25397,0,9516

16733900,No Man's Sky,84923291,"It delivers on exploration, immersion and generally is fun enough to keep me busy.

It does get a bit repetitive action wise but currently still outweighed by the different planets, biomes, etc with a variety of different items, building options etc.

The biggest problems are with multiplayer quest issues (especially the Specialist quests bugging out and not being able to be completed until starting a solo game) and with general graphics and quest glitches.
Graphics are constantly loading at low quality, and there is frequent clipping issues (this is both on PC and PS4 for context). Flying accidently into a flower or mushroom on a planet will often result in your ship getting fully stuck and then you die. Quests will often bug out on dialogue options or fully freeze (especially in multiplayer when 2 people access terminals at the same time), updates to quests are inconsistent (exploring/identifying quests are a prime example), warping into a planet because it didn't stop when on hyperdrive...
For base building, flatting the ground or taking a mountain out of the way however is a huge problem. The removed mountains will spawn back in at some point and just mess up your whole base. On top of that, it'll create clipping issues where you can just fall straight through.
This all combined can make the game extremely frustrating. Saving often thus becomes a must.

I would still recommend the game as it is fun to play with friends. Because it's cross platform, it's one of the few games my wife and I can play together. And because of the reputation that HG has build back up, I trust that over time, things will continue to improve (and likely break when new features are launched) but it has been worth the money I spend on the game.",1610993188,1610993188,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197990915171,120,4,6856,5649,6089

Two years later and I can finally recommend this game.  After patches that introduced base buidling, owning freighters and true multiplayer, this game is finally fulfilling its promise.

The above being said, other than playing if for a couple of hours the other night, I haven't played this game since I wrote my original review.  I'll update my review once I've played a little more.

-------------------------------------------------
Original:

I played 50 hours and definitely got my money's worth out of it.  So obviously, fun can be had in this game.

Unfortunately, I can't recommend this game to most people.  The game simply doesn't live up to its promise.  It quickly becomes repetitive and you aren't given compelling reasons to keep on exploring.

Great short games exist and great long games exist.  This is a good short game that's trying to pretend that it's a long game.  You will probably happily play the game until you eventually get bored.  This may or may not happen quickly and probably before you ""complete"" the game.  If you're ok with that, then you might enjoy the game.  If not, you should probably stay away from it.",1472240529,1532721066,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197970323060,286,3,7704,0,2899

Get it if you want, but it leaves a lot to be desired. I'm too pissed off putting so many hours into this game and finding more things to bitch about then brag about. Mods were the only thing I let my hopes ride on and they came through well enough. But the fact that I had to rely on mods making this game enjoyable again after the 2nd playthrough really disappointed me. Creation Club has now ruined that too.

You begin as a commoner, a simple peasant, the master blacksmith's son. You know nothing of the world out there yet, and war has come to your country. It will be up to you to learn the basics of swordsmanship, archery, herbalism, bartering and earn the respect of the nobles and peasants alike.

There are so many factors included in this game, like dressing. You can try talking at anyone while wearing a full plate and spurs and they will respect you, even treating you as a knight, regardless of your status.

You can steal items and keep them with you for some time, or even use them, to later sell without any penalty. Alas, who knows the origin of the product? No one will suspect of your intentions if you are smart enough.  

In combat, you can go and challenge three bandits at once and actually die for recklesness. There is no difficulty level and you are not a godlike person, even when full armored and using the biggest hammer avaiable. You can also bleed to death, starve, get drunk, break your ankles, fall from the horse, among other things. 

The inventory looks great, the map, the codex, the missions and their descriptions, the random events (duels, bandit attacks, looters and thieves)...

Needs improvements and bug fixes, of course, but having a decent rig helps a lot. 

Totally worth it. 9.5/10

3015858,The Forest,10352177,"Okay, so firstly I would like to say this is pre-alpha. There's bound to be quite a bit of bugs/glitches as well as some other problems. But I think considering this is the first release and it is pre-alpha they have done quite well. I have never felt the thrill of trying to survive as much as this game, the way you have to satisfy your needs such as hunger and thirst, the realistic wood chopping, the realistic fishing, it is like a survival simulator. Amazing. 

The A.I... Wow.. Just released yet the A.I are quite clever. My first encounter with the Tribe, there were 2 Tribesmen standing a distance away just staring at me, stalking me... As though they were scouting. They soon ran off, I thought to myself ""Okay this is either very good, or very bad.."" Alas my worries were met when they came back with an extra 3 Tribesmen, 5 in total. They were all standing a distance away, watching me.. They soon split up and started to flank me. It felt like I was in the ocean surrounded by 5 hungry sharks. Soon after, as they were all in position, the ring leader decided to have the first go, charging at me and hitting me, they all followed and began running at me from different directions, I killed one of them and then the rest ran away either climbing the trees and jumping tree to tree or just vanishing into the depths of the Forest. I will never forget that experience. 

Crafting is quite fun and it makes you feel accomplished, having to go hunt for rocks, sticks, logs etc. Day and night cycle is wonderfully done, night time looks amazing when you have built a shelter and a camp fire. Fishing is quite amazing as well, very realistic. 

My only real critique of this game is the sound and the saving/loading. There needs to be more Ambient sounds, the start of the airplane crash, it needs to have better sound, just the game in general, though I must say the sound inside the caves is absolutely beautiful. The saving/loading currently does not work, but I am sure this will be fixed in future updates.  

If you don't mind bugs and glitches and the lack of saving/loading (for now) then this game is definitely worth it. Amazing game and I REALLY look forward to being able to play coop.",1401943477,1401943477,True,1,0,0,True,True,76561198063226391,113,9,1390,0,322

5020830,Borderlands 3,66208620,"Here's the thing: I was quite looking forward to playing this game. I'd played the other three (and their respective DLC, over a long period of time), and liked them. 

But I was only -quite- looking forward to playing Borderlands 3. I didn't buy it when it came out over at The Other Place, and wasn't that bothered about the wait. I was pretty tired of certain aspects of the series, and was worried that Gearbox wouldn't do anything about them.

Well guess what - it's five steps forward and six back. There's loads of improvements on the basic formula: more gun variety (and I mean -real- variety, not ten million reskins of the same dozen guns plus a couple of memes thrown in), better gun-feel, more varied class builds etc. I really enjoyed all this.

But on the other fronts it's so, so much worse. The game feels totally pointless - the plot is incoherent, the characters are all utter moonunits (Christ I wish I was shooting the Sanctuary wankers rather than whoever the enemies are supposed to be), and the only really interesting aspect of the world, the corporations, have been turned into bland joke-factories. Post-scarcity megacorporation takes on the powers of the state and behaves appallingly isn't exactly a new setup for a scifi property, but in Borderlands it was at least bearable, unlike the gaspingly boring aliens nonsense they're always trying to shoehorn in. The Vaults were better when they were just big treasure-chests rather than silly armageddon engines left by a species of forgetful amazon alexas. The missions are dull as sin. Rooms after rooms of boring, idiotic enemies with thousands of hitpoints and no clue. The game is way too easy, entirely skill-free; and yet it still feels like a real slog to play, as if it's taking a thousand years to do anything. It's like eating a whole box of crackers with nothing to drink.

Borderlands writing has always been sub-Reddit garbage for people who think The Big Bang Theory is funny - but in the past it leant into that in such a way that it at least felt self-possessed. It knew what it was doing. It doesn't any more. It's now objectively wretched, criminally stupid and likely an actual moral threat to those who come into contact with it. This game will quite possibly make you a worse person: cruder, duller, worn down by its grim neoliberal smugness. I genuinely object to it. The Vatican used to ban art like this, and they were right to do so.

On a more prosaic note it also runs like the juice from the bottom of the bin. I've got a fairly indifferent setup, but well within the required and nearly to the recommended. It just chugs and whirrs and tears and grinds, even on low settings (I played mostly on mid-to high, and got around 45-50 fps most of the time - playable but not enjoyable). How it still functions this badly nearly a year out from launch is beyond Man or God to fathom. I guess Gearbox were too busy coming up with gimcrack new memes to shove through their rubbish DLCs and right down your throat.

It also looks ugly as anything - loads of horrible bloom and blur - which is a shame, given that the artstyle was always one of the appealing parts of Borderlands, and the previous games have aged really well. The 'Pre-Sequel' was a pretty mediocre game, but it did manage to look better than this.

Just not good.",1585614950,1585615055,False,1,1,0,True,False,76561198069994888,103,4,5307,0,1648

 Great game with cool lore, mechanics and art with a few pacing issues near the end of the game. Impressivly only made by two people, pick up the game if you like souls like games

Long version of review:
Salt and Sanctuary has definetly been one of my most enjoyed games as of recent. I feel that it perfectly translates the feel and mechanics of the ""Souls Like"" genre into a 2D enviroment while the two man indie team at SKA Studios adds their own grunge bleak feeling to the game with the art and lore within the game. I have just recently beaten the game after going back and forth between playing SnS and other new titles to hit the scene but now that I have completed it, I'm sad that I didn't beat it earlier! Mechanically, it's fluid and fun to play with many many differnt play styles to choose from with the skill tree. The game has several different stories some of which I am to discover and will defintly be playing through it again on NewGame+ to try to discover details I missed. My biggest complaint in about the game is the progression towards the end; once you hit about level 80, you really dont need to level much more to beat the game. Another thing is that the beginning of the game had all these fleshed out areas that you really really had to get to know and go back and fourth through to grind and find secrets and items yet at the end of the game, it feels like you just kinda blow through the last 2 areas or so. My final complaint is with the final boss, it comes up very abbruptly imo, perhaps it's because I didn't do all of the side questing to get ALL of the lore, but by the end of it all it didn't feel like the boss fight was lead up to very well. I had slain the boss before and then suddenly this guy is talking to me about the final boss and then boom there he is. Despite these flaws, I think that the game is a great balance of fun and frustration with interesting lore and eviroments. I defintly reccomend that you buy this game if you like ""Souls Like"" games and I will defintly be following SKA Studios in hopes they make any more games at this level of quality.",1529367161,1529367161,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198119523823,362,12,3393,0,2681

EDIT: Just to add that the Portuguese (BR) localization is pretty weak. Many typos, several really literal translations, little to no creativity, very weak effort to preserve the tone of voice of the source material and a few glaring screw-ups that really destroy the moment. A particular instance of 'goodbye' being translated as 'tchau' (""bye"" or ""see you"") at a very pivotal moment was particularly egregious.

My first indie game that I played and bought on steam happened to be Gunpoint. Ever since I got the game, I have had countless hours of enjoyable fun with over 4 playthroughs already to my profile and also a steam community workshop item. Ever since I bought the game, I have been able to watch it grow and prosper through the new updates along with the new community fanbase, something that is easily visible through the steam workshop titles, and also the third party programs that people have used in partnership with the developers to design custom levels with textures other than from in the regular editor. My personal opinion of the game coming into it was that of excitement and joy, because of how the game was a perfect match to my playing style and how it was easy enough to get achievements (which I love). It provided me with a 4 hour straight period of joy and commitment that led to me wanting more out of the game and also the game's level editor. I felt the need after everything, to show my experience with the world and essentially show how much fun the game was. Overall however, the game's graphics are smooth and artful, providing a meaningful experience even on ""toasters"" that will never fail to provide you with continous fun throughout your day.

20759721,DYNASTY WARRIORS 9,40244029,"EDIT: Changing my review to negative due to two reasons
the main one being the bad DLC practices (Including gating off original weapons with weak reasoning)
The second being that the game could have used a lot more pollish in the long run, and the further you play it the more it sadly falls apart, with the negative starting to overwhelm the positive.
Tl;Dr It feels more of a spin off than a main series game, and very experimental, but not outright bad.
A must get for those who like the setting and characters, as they are very well handled.

Review proper:
Dont mind the jim sterling fanboys, the game is not bad
BUT, its not a straight up warriors game, as it has more in common with bladestorm and kessen than the core DW series, feeling more like a spin off (specially with all the stuff they experiment with) than a main game.

gameplay:
Its less of a beat-em up and more (VERY) light strategy with how it handle things, with a massive focus on actually moving your frontline and alies into combat properly; you can try to do everything alone, but even mooks will swarm and agressively attack you if you do, helping your army get to where you need it is everything, so they can keep other enemies and mooks off you while you fight important enemies directly (which is, admitingly, a bit on the easy side, though, again, it gets balanced with how agressive mooks and other officers can be)
the combat itself is now focused almost entirelly on positioning and keeping enemies combo-ed in a way that they cant counter, and is, at its very basic, simplified from the regular series.

Writing and plot:
writing, presentation and characterisation wise this is one of the best dw games so far, with characters actually having good and believeable interactions and details, for the most part, handled very well; if you are in the series for the characters and settings, this is a MUST get, as exploring the beautifully crafted world is fun, even if said world is rather amateurish when it comes to open worlds.

World: 
the world looks beautiful, but feels empty and could have been better realized
when in towns, vilalges or when everything works, it looks and feels great

You will most likely find better, longer-lasting atmospheric story-driven point-and-click games out there (hell, for the limited gameplay they offer, atmosphere and story are about all point-and-clicks HAVE).

The mechanics in place for avoiding the monsters are pretty cool, and I wish the development team had done more with those elements, but the game seems to just... give up on them at the 60-percent mark, which is a damn shame (you only run into two different monster types during a playthrough). They were the most active elements of gameplay, and the only actual threats you ever encounter (not to mention a solid complement to the atmosphere).

An awesome game made better by all the DLC/Expansions. If you like Civ you will love Civ V. I got it on sale with all the DLC and it became one of my favorite games rather quickly. If you have played it without the expansions and DLC please pick them up. They improve the gameplay immensely. I have over 500 hours in it and feel like I easily have 500 more to go before I am tired of it. Highly recommend, one of the few 10/10 games I have played in 3 decades of gaming.

April 2020 Edit:

It seems this game has issues working on Windows 10 and has had consistent crashes. If it were just me having these issues I would leave my review as is but a quick google search will show you that others have the same issues. I have tried to verify the game files and each time it says 3 files are incorrect and it re-downloads them and each time they are still incorrect. I will have to reconsider buying Fireaxis games in the future as they seem to not care about the multitude of people with similar issues.

You'll end up 'playing' for 5 hours trying to get the very basic graphics options to work, and when you finally do get the to work more than likely die to random falling bombs and physics objects. No, I'm not exaggerating. 

Right now, FO4 is buggy beyond belief, to the point that you have a 75% chance of not being able to progress in the story because of a game breaking bug that crashes your game, and has no work around beyond simply cheating with console commands. The physics are what you expect out of Gmod-- No, that's insulting Gmod, they're what you expect out of a Gmod knockoff, where if you kill someone, flip a coin. If heads, they start spazing out and flailing around as a ragdoll. That can kill you if you get too close. Yep, you kill a guy, go to loot his body, and DIE from the body. Thats just one out of a literal list of hundereds of problem gitches.

On top of that, it's a console port; it was originally designed for console, then ported upwards with the inferior restrictions still in place, as well as the 0 Optimization policy of consoles still intact. It's so bad that specs no longer matter; professional gamers with TITANS...TITANS...and the rigs to break the NSA are reporting major drops in FPS-- which is also linked to the physics engine. So if you g o from 60 to 30, suddenly the physics stop working...

This is not worth $60 usd right now. It might not be worth it ever. But on the off chance it does become such, wait. Don't buy it now. The gameplay is Okay.

3739728,Hollow Knight,32712468,"+ A good mix of simple Combat with smooth Platforming. 
  One does not make you want to stop doing the other. Which is usually an issue with Metroidvania games. Both Combat and Platforming are fluid. So you don't ever feel like you're stuck doing one.

+ Artstyle and Lore complements the Challenge and Exploration of the gameplay.
  Basically the dark atmosphere fits the gameplay. You venture into the unknown, looking for new challenges while discovering good looking places.

+ Navigation is fun.
  It is easy to use the map, the rooms are shaped very nicely so it is usually not difficult to remember which room is which one.

+ The Challenge is there.
  But simply comparing the gameplay to Dark Souls just because it is hard is not right. Dark Souls actively makes you try to think and find a weakness in enemies' movement, you can't just go in and out. However this game makes you depend on your motor skills. You can win a fight for fighting well without over-analyzing them. It does not punish you as much when you make a mistake. You don't fall off a cliff and die instantly or get one-shot.

o The Dark Souls feel

 The game is made to feel like Dark Souls. It is dark, challenging, has NPC's that give lore away. Sure. But nobody actually bothers to tell what is different about it. It is more lighthearted in the way it looks and plays. Very cartoonish, NPCs are not all downers and they are mostly very cute. Gameplay-wise it feels way faster as you're not afraid of punishment. You actually explore places zipping around instead of crawling through the kingdom in paranoia of getting ambushed.

o There is some lore there. But it feels like it ""tries"" to be a thing like Souls.

  There is the corrupting Infection much like the Abyss in Dark Souls. Collecting souls is a source of power for some reason. You can interact with Dreams. It is nice that these concepts are there, they are cool, they bring depth to the world, but there is little explanation to why they are there. Unlike how simply Dark and Abyss are opposed to the Fire in Souls, Hollow Knight throws more characters and concepts, quotes/flashbacks from the past. It makes it harder to keep track of which are related. Why are you Hollow? Why do you fill yourself with soul and dreams? Why are there concepts of Light and Dark in this game? What is ""The Infection"" ? It feels like they are only there to be an allegory and not that much related to the game. The idea is not refined enough. The ""light and dark"" is too much up the nose. The whole ""pale being"" thing is overstated while ""dreams and souls"" go untouched although there is some meat there, a story to tell.
 
 But after all, it is a game about some fallen bug kingdom where different kinds of bugs are united. They have some silly language. It tries to be fun and it succeeds. It is really nice those weird concepts are there in the first place. There is not much reason to complain about the lore, it is more about there is not enough of it.


- The game has a true ending. 
To get to that you should work a little more which kinda felt like a ""grind"" even though it is technically is not.
It repeats some bosses in a ""harder"" mode, it makes you go through a platforming gauntlet. It is really not that much of an issue, but it surely slows the pace of the game down by removing the ""exploration"" aspect.

- The economy of the game is kinda weird. 
  If you die twice in a row without recieving your shade (similar to Souls again) you lose all your money. But there are not many things to spend your money on anyway. It is sort of an empty threat and not the big deal the game makes it seem to be.

- Backtracking is sometimes a hassle. 
  Some of the Stag Stations (simply fast travel points) are not useful enough. Although it is fun to move around, sometimes walking to that one place you wanted to check out seems like some busywork when you already know there is nothing interesting on your way.",1498283081,1515590431,True,3,0,0,True,False,76561198012345703,507,68,1956,0,1880

Until a game comes around that provides a more realistic approach to the genre i think pubg is going to be on the top.

It needs more optimisation for sure, but according to the dev news, they are working on it as priority 1., and now they began to release updates more regularly in smaller sizes, which for one thing helps to keep them accountable on making progress, and helps them debug the game more since a big patch once in a blue moon can introduce hundreds of bugs and only god knows what caused what.

They recently filed a lawsuit against EpicGames for copyright infringement, which is obviously ludicrous, but oh well lets see how much money pubg loses with this. 

i feel that the review scores for this game are at the moment incredibely off, as a lot of people come to leave a review that they disagree with the lawsuit or that ""RIP PUBG"" cause fortnite became more popular. Just lol, they are two very different games in the same genre.

in the end, i would recommend this game, since early access a lot has improved and a lot still needs to improve but i cant say ive experienced any game breaking bugs, the cheater community is basically non-existent in europe, and the game is all around very fun if you search for a realistic approach to the genre.",1510570930,1527838058,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198028337699,149,2,39908,0,28290

the point that the fucking ""creators"" made such complications on how mods can be used on this game is just embarassing.

imagine if you sheath your weapons on your back rather than your hip. 
EPIC
but no. in this game, if you dont use mods, then it gets so broad, and ugly, and plain. 
This game ""vanilla"" is only worth playing if you dont ""know"" the cheat codes, because you will hack if you know them, its just so easy to hack you just press ` and type the commands. 
or if you dont have internet.
i know some games that are like, 
but ill give you a list of what i mean.

Play with internet games
and 
play without internet games.
skyrim is to play ""without mods"" when you have no internet. 
if you have mods, then you really need internet but thats not the point. 
i am talking about vanilla skyrim.
vanilla skyrim is just so bad. and you cant even finish the game with vanilla skyrim. xD 
there are some bugs that dont allow you to finish some missions and therefore you cant finish the game or finish that specific mission. 
if youwant to finish all the missions in skyrim then you need ""mods"" or ""extra mody like files to add to your skyrim because if you dont you cant finish some games""
yes. so i will say a no. because mods are what made this game the best.

or hit its prime.
skyrim is a good game. but talking from experience
you should not buy this game if you HATE mods.

5762008,Stardew Valley,44871331,"Moving into Stardew Valley is totally the best decision ever. Very relaxing and very engrossing. If someone asked me for a game-therapy, I’ll suggest Stardew Valley right away. It totally helps you chase those stresses away.

To think Stardew Valley as [i]just a farming simulator[/i] is [b]an understatement[/b]. Yes, Stardew Valley may look similarly like Harvest Moon game where you are planting crops then watering and eventually harvesting them, turning a profit, then re-investing that profit in expanding your farm in a variety of interesting ways.

However, the stories in this game itself are truthfully beautiful and very meaningful. You begin your adventure by leaving your office job for a change of pace and to start a new authentic life on a farm. You move to the fresh countryside, in a small rural town named Pelican, to run a farm left to you by your grandfather. In this village, you meet and socializing with your new neighbors, adjusting and learning how to become self-sustainable. The appeal of Stardew Valley is so much broader in scope and design, and as the in-game days’ progress, you will start to become invested in this little slice of heaven you have carved out and the people who surround you.

Moreover, what makes Stardew Valley so [b]shockingly absorbing[/b] is due to its [b]successful mixture of repetition[/b], [b]adorable pixel graphics[/b], [b]light soothing music[/b], and that [b]'just one more day' feel[/b] makes it the ideal game which you just feel like living in Stardew Valley forever. Yup, no kidding - [b]this game is really, really THAT GOOD[/b] that it never really providing you any stopping point.

Furthermore, Stardew Valley has the most friendly and welcoming community I have ever seen. It is a community where someone can ask newbie questions, and they will get lots of friendly explanation, guidance, and positive feedback.

Overall, I genuinely love this game wholeheartedly to the point where I find myself thinking about it when I’m not playing it, idly wondering what I want to do next or thinking about how to decorate my farms or what crops should I be planting during the next season and so on. Honestly, I can’t think of anything that I would classify it as a true flaw. [b]This game is absolutely incredible, and will not disappoint.[/b]

-Has a good ""bad"" sense of humor. Meaning they 100% go for lame jokes and it works.
-[u]Settings gives you freedom[/u] to get the notifications that you want, and nothing more.
-[u]The game has a depth to it[/u], hiring a doctor with bad traits or placing objects at certain places will maybe make patients die left and right. There is a niche here, that for me, makes the game more interesting and fun to play.
-[u]Controls are easy[/u], and you get the opportunity to copy rooms
[b]The bad[/b]
-[u]Building rooms are very repetitive and annoying[/u]. You will most likely need an office, but every time you get a new hospital, you'll have to build it again. 
-Although controls are easy, [u]the menu is difficult and weird[/u]. And there is little information about it in the tutorial
[b]Proposed improvements[/b]
-Selfmade Blueprints of rooms easy to access
-Remake the menu and have a proper tutorial

 The art style is adorable and beautiful yet simple, The art at the end of each level is just amazing.
 The controls are responsive and fast, where It's really fun to just mess around with them.

 The music by Lena Raine is top notch with some highlights being ""Scattered and lost"", ""Resurrections"", and ""First steps"" you can really just 'feel' how much effort and talent went into this soundtrack.

Even though I've beat the main story I've still got quite a bit to go such as the B-sides (harder versions of the levels) and all the strawberries (the main collectable).

2215229,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,61574755,"Civ 6 takes some of the great changes made in Civ 5 and adds to them with the introduction of city districts. Some people may not like this change but I feel like it adds some more depth to the strategy of the game. 

Most buildings require a specific district rather than constructing all buildings in the city center. If you want to build a university your city needs to have a campus. In addition to having unique buildings, each district also gains adjacency bonuses depending on the surrounding tiles. A campus gains additional science when placed next to a mountain, for example.

This game also makes some changes to worker units, now called builders, which require a bit more planning to use over previous titles in the series as they have a limited number of uses per unit. These charges are spent to create mines, farms, fishing boats, clear forests, etc.  Initially, builders only have three charges, but this can be improved by the use of Policies. 

In Civ 6 each civilization has a government type that grants a number of policy slots in one of four flavors. The first of these types are the military policies, which can grant addition combat experience to your units or can make them cheaper to produce. A second type are commercial policies, which can increase the number of builder charges, make settlers cheaper to produce, improve district adjacency bonuses, and more. Diplomatic policies grant bonuses geared towards improving your relations with city-states. Finally, the last type of policy are the wildcards. Typically these policies increase the rate that you generate great people for your empire.

These are just a few of the changes that have been made in this edition of my favorite series. All of these are included in the base game. Even without the DLC expansions this game feels complete and I prefer playing it over any of the previous titles!

16027894,Cities: Skylines,14829819,"It has been so long since we had a good city builder game. Many have tried and failed. Then Cities Skylines comes along and revitalizes the whole genre. Hat off! 
In short they have done an excellent job. Nice and crisp graphics. Even colour filtres to support different regions. Good sound which change depending on your zoom level. A stable and modable game with a simple interface. Real simulation of people and the city in general. I mean this is simply amazing. Thank you VERY much!
However...
There are a few things which bugs me. Do not missunderstand me. I love this game. It is fantastic. But they have still managed to do some things which is less than stellar.

First is the whole thing with zones which are bound to roads. Roads dominate. Without them you can not do much at all. Destroy roads (or upgrade too much) and houses simply goes away. Any pre-planning you want to do must come from laying out roads first. Want sidewalks? Prepare to loose zone areas. 
This ""car centric"" way of planning annoys me greatly. It make the whole building  less enjoyable. Roads everywhere. People do walk but it seems more for show. What I would like to see is the old way of first plonking down your zones and THEN the roads. 

Connected to this is also the somewhat cumbersome upgrade system of ... yes you guessed.... roads. There are limitations. Some roads can not be upgraded unless you first remove them. Do this and zones dissapear. Others, which can be upgraded (or downgraded) messes up the whole zone connected to it. Put down a wider road and the zone shrinks and houes come and goes. Instead of simply moving the zone with the road. Annoying like you would not believe. 

No undo function. You can always remove things you did wrong. But even if you get most of the money back you still end up loosing money. Simply due to misstakes or simple planning. 

Roads can very easily become your undoing long before your city has become anything. They are over complicated I think. 

During play you unlock stuff. New buildings. New roads and other things. Some of these stages are quite odd. 
For instance: you start with industry. But in order to have farms or wood industry (which should exist before any other type of industry) you have to play quite a while. 
The unlocks are tied to the city size. So somethings can not be done unless you first do a mockup and grow. After which you then remove what you did not want to begin with. Thankfully a mod from the developers makes it possible to unlock all progress but still use a normal budget. I like this alot better. 

I will end with the somwhat lackluster notification system. You get feedback via a Twitter like bird (Twirp?). Annoying like all hell. Essentially the first thing to be turned off. But except from this and small symbols over buildings, there are very little feedback.
It is extremly easy to create a feedback death spiral which kills off your city in no time flat. 
Sometimes you check in on a building (you can zoom all the way to street level - most excellent!) and it seem to work. But somehow you do not see it doing anything. Like graveyards. It can say it works normally. It has a number of slots for cars and dead bodies. But you can never tell if it works. I had firestations whith 8 trucks. But they simply never ever left the building. Stuff burned to the ground all over. But when I moved them they suddenly started to use the trucks. Buggs? have no idea.

So yes the feedback system, despite many nice filtres and info views, are lacking quite alot. 

Now all this text might seem like I hate the game. But I don't. I got it the moment I could pay for it without pre-purchase. At full price. BUT it needs tweaking. More so in some areas than others.  I think people in general have waited so long for a game this good they simply do not see these issues. Yet. 

But I have hope. Thankfully the game is highly moddable and I think the devs are motivated to improve it as time goes by. It is a financial success, or at least will become one.  
Despite some issues it is a very good game. It will have long life so you'll get alot for your money. No online demand - imagine that! :-O

At its core, ARK is yet another take on the ""Survival game"" trope. What tries to set it apart is its (at least initially) Jurassic theme. You'll be exploring a land of dinosaurs, both friendly and hostile.

While you can play it on your own offline, the real experience can be found online on either official or unofficially run servers, both in PvE and PvP. Band together in tribes to fight other tribes.

As for the actual gameplay - It is in constant development, which is very noticable from downright terrible performance, even on high end machines. Base building and dinosaur AI is also somewhat crippled at the moment.

All the changes they have implemented have massively improved the game. They could've pocketed the money and walked away, but they committed to fixing what they made, and kudos to them. Sure, this is ""expected"", but many developers just close their ears and move on. Not Hello Games. The game is actually pretty fun now, and I'm looking forward to the future to see it improved even more. Good work Hello Games!  

Like thousands of others, I was fascinated by the potential of this game and was hoping it wouldprovide a cool and amazing galaxy to explore. Unfortunately, we were all misled by Hello Games, and specifically Sean Murray on what would be in this game. No multiplayer, no massive space battles, and no other way to play the game other than mine, refuel, then repeat. Over and over and over again until you want to claw your eyes out. There were several now infamous interviews with Sean where he said that this stuff would be in the game. I understand some reasoning that things got cut, but communication is crucial here, and he had ample time to convey that and be honest. Instead, he didn't, and now many people will never trust the developer again. This is made worse by the fact they still use a 2014 trailer here as the first thing you see.

5135148,Sekiro™: Shadows Die Twice,51117668,"I had a little dilemma when back in March. It was either this game, or Mortal Kombat 11. [b] I ultimately chose Sekiro, and I don't regret a single cent of my decision. [/b]

At it's core, Sekiro is a rhythm game - block this, parry that and counter-attack at the right time. It's gruelling and it's difficult especially on your first playthrough where quite literally everything is stacked against you but as you learn to spot patterns and cycles in your enemies, suddenly they don't feel as menacing compared to the first time you encountered them. The game really starts to shine, in my opinion, on your second playthrough where you spend less of your time trying to trudge through the game and more of it into actually appreciating the game for what it truly is: artistically, graphically, narratively or other wise.

The only legitimate complaints I have is that a [i]lot[/i] of the minibosses and even bosses are reused and recycled sometimes even multiple times. Though in the case of bosses, they usually have a different or additional moveset to keep things fresh. Minibosses on the other hand, can appear and reappear repetitiously upwards of 4 times in a single playthrough which can feel somewhat 'cheap' if you will.

The other complaint I have is with the camera which can lead to some unintentional and most certainly BS deaths in some critical moments. For the most, part the camera cooperates as well as you would expect it to but if you get pinned to a wall for example, prepare to meet an untimely demise. 

Other than that, Sekiro is a solid game in most if not every aspect; graphically, artistically, narratively, gameplay wise and more. I would highly recommend this game in general. And this is coming from a newby firstcomer, who's never touched a FromSoft game prior to this.",1559999158,1559999158,True,1,0,0,True,False,76561198096134839,93,12,15481,0,4525
16680172,ARK: Survival Evolved,21492674,"Well, to say the least about this game: Dinosaurs.

To actually give you something to think about, lets continue.

This is an incredibly interesting game, with many ups and downs. Not only does it allow for players to build their own bases, create their own clothing, and truly survive with dinosaurs prowling at your front door (if you built one),  it lets you build your own guns, explosives, and tame your very own Monster-Saurus-Rex!

But this game has a lot of draw-backs. The very first is that it is, in it's very basic form, tedious. For all of the hours I've logged, I'd say about 20% of them were interesting or exciting. The rest were me collecting rocks on the beach, or trying to find a server that didn't have some jerk with a machine-gun hunting down level 1 players.

Sure there are PVE servers, but not having anyone to fight takes literally all of the fun out of it. Who's going to blow open your compound and let loose a swarm of angry raptors? Not the enviroment. So you're left with two options; find a community that doesn't suck out of the sixty to seventy thousand servers out there, or find some friends who have the ability to host a server, and hope they have the money to support it for a while.

When you really get into it, it's a great game with lots to do and really interesting technical abilities. But until you REALLY get into it, it's the most tedious thing to do, and that's why I can't say it's worth a buy.

Edit:

After an additional 400 hours, I stand by my original critique. At least for the core game.

Finding a server with good administration and moderation is key, but not only is it important to have good people maintaining a server, so too is finding proper modifications for the game.

A properly modded and maintained server makes this game ten thousand times more forgiving and interesting. It takes away the tedium (a lot) and adds new levels of excitement as raids no longer become tribe ending affairs but are instead fun events to put equipment, time, and energy towards.

If you were unlucky enough to become an Alpha on a regular server and lost everything as the other tribes banded together against you, try the modded side of the game. You won't go back. It's almost a guarantee. Not that it's for the wrong reasons, the grind is still there and the difficulty didn't change, in fact, you may find it even harder to get that top tier creature you wanted as some mods make their levels astronomically larger. But maybe you'll be like me and you'll enjoy the new versions of ARK without fear of losing everything if you fall into the wrong place.",1456558017,1604878620,True,0,0,0,False,True,76561197971950280,195,17,36511,0,7414

20654268,My Time At Portia,61190948,"I really like this game.  I've had my eye on it since it came into early access, but I wanted to wait until it was finished to play it myself. It's centered around a fairly complex crafting system that I really enjoy.  I like that you can set your machines to run and go do something else.  Between fishing, mining in ruins, and gathering other resources, there's always something to do.  It's really satisfying to build things and I like being able to finish big projects.

The personal quests, side quests, and commissions for the main missions can sometimes gang up on you and there are times I felt rushed and pressured to get certain things done.  I don't like failing quests, so it's stressed me out a couple of times, but I think it's just the partial randomness of quests that appear.   I did have to drop one commission because I didn't have the machine diagram from the research center yet and I couldn't afford to get stuck with an order I couldn't finish for days while I waited for it to show up.

The relationship system seems a bit slow to me and takes a lot of work, but I've only gotten near the end of year one so far and it looks like the map has larger sections.  There's plenty of time to get to know everyone in town, it will just take work.  I like that all of the people have lots of varied dialog depending on what's happening with the main quest.  It makes it worth it to do the rounds and talk to everyone periodically.   I love that everyone has their own relationship tree and when you move to a different stage of relationship with one person, everyone related to them gets a relationship boost.  It's a nice touch.

The only big criticism I have is for the cooking and the recipes from Django.  The cooking station is more complicated than it needs to be and it doesn't function like other machines.  It's like a mini game where you have to add ingredients one at a time with a timer.  And the results are usually spoiled food or Tasteless Broth which has infinite combinations for the same thing as far as I can see. 

The recipe system needs an overhaul.  There should only be one combination of ingredients for each recipe and they should make logical sense.  (It confuses me so much that dough is fish food and not a recipe ingredient.)  The recipes that Django provides should never include Tasteless Broth.  I think I'm up to ten combinations of meat and another ingredient to make this.  It's frustrating and not fun.  I don't even want to talk to him anymore.  

The cooking station should function like other machines where it pulls items from boxes and inventory to cook on a timer.  The mini game for discovering recipes can remain, but it should be a different machine entirely.  More recipes should be available on the grill.  There are only two options right now for me: roasted meat or roasted fish.  It's boring and a waste of space in my yard for so little function.   As it is, I actively stay away from cooking because I don't want to bother with it.  I usually love cooking in games, but I'm going to have to review how I feel about this one before I try to do it again.

Overall, I love playing this game despite a few annoyances and things that could be improved.  I'm always driven to play one more day (to the point where I'm up until really late at night even though I need to get up the next morning.)   It's definitely worth playing if you enjoy games with crafting systems.  There is farming, but it's not quite like other games.  I haven't played with it enough to get a feel for it and I haven't build a Shed or a Coop for animals yet.

However when you get to the higher levels or endgame, it slowly becomes very p2w.

How is it p2w you ask? Well, you slowly gain rewards for playing the game, weekly, daily etc. Which can increase carry capacity, pets, cosmetic gear and items that make upgrading/getting better gear easier. However this is things you can just buy in the cashshop to have instantly and make the game significantly easier to progress in.

The game is all about gear progression. With low gear you cannot outplay someone with way better gear than you. You do no damage to him, and he 1-2 hits you. If you're willing to whip out your wallet, you can get the gear faster and upgrade it easier. If you dont want to spend a lot of money on this game, it takes a lot longer to get there. Dont get me wrong, you definitely can play this game without spending money, but it's simply so much slower.

Personally, I'm not very good at turnbased games but i still find them enjoyable and the ""normal"" difficulty is still difficult enough for me to feel a sense of accomplishment at the end without the addition of shame.  A definite recommendation as an easy, free-time sort of play through with side missions/areas nicely blended into the overall storyline.  I don't find the storyline particularly distinctive, but it doesn't take away from the game very much.  it still interested me enought to buy it, after all.",1545005646,1545005646,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198045049273,163,9,454,0,450

--NWI listens to a very vocal minority or very vocal inexperienced player base rather than their competitive community and experienced FPS players. Polling to see ""what the community wants"" is a terrible idea. People are stupid and don't even know what they want. 

--Map design is very bad. Maps are huge, cluttered, and aren't focused with gameplay in mind. On my part they also run like garbage. Ins2 had mostly pretty well designed maps, how do you mess those up adding them to Sandstorm? 

--Competitive scene needed a ranked mode that wasn't broken with bugs or dead. Maybe DGL can keep it alive. 

--Fire the person who decided it was a good idea to have doors all over competitive firefight maps

20632402,Ni no Kuni™ II: Revenant Kingdom,42995054,"I've beaten the game on the PS4, and this is the first time I've played on steam. I have a good 50 hours clocked in on this game so hear me out.

I grew up playing KOTOR/KOTOR II, Diablo 2, WC3, and other anime inspired MMORPG's like Flyff growing up. I think because of this, I fell in love with the RPG genre. I'm currently in my early 20's and I started to branch out into JRPG's. I was put off by first because the pacing and flow of a traditional western style RPG is very different than JRPG's and Ni no Kuni II is no different. 

If you've watched and like Sudio Ghibli films growing up such as Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle, or Grave of the Fireflies; then you will have profound appreciation for this game. The art style is impeccable and the voice acting is great. I really prefer the english voice acting over the japanese because they really nailed the emotion behind the lines. The game itself feels like another Studio Ghibli movie, with all of it's charm, story telling, and moral lessons it teaches you. If you are younger than me, chances are you will like this game more than I did and I like it alot. 

The combat is a hit or miss. It can be considered a hack and slash. You have quick attacks, strong attacks, skills and spells. You have teammates you can rotate in and out of combat, each with their own personalities that they bring to the party. The animation is very very fluid, it's like eye candy seeing your characters fight and interact with each other. If you enjoy anime, Studio Ghibli, or if your just a casual gamer nowadays like me - then you will write the combat off as a pass and enjoy it with the rest of the game. If you are more of an intense gamer, if you've never played JRPG's before, or if you need more stimulation than button tapping, then you will hate the combat and it will be a deal breaker for you. Some of the negative reviews press on this hard. I'm telling you as it is. Don't buy this game if this is a deal breaker for you. 

Some of you may not like this game because you are old, meaning you might not appreciate the game for what it's trying to capture you for. I've read some of the negative reviews, and a common trend amongst them are that the story is too corny, too bland, and too predictable. Unfortunately for those of you thinking you might not like this, chances are you will not like it. The story was designed to be what others call ""corny, bland, or too predictable"". It is the way the story is meant to be told and written. There is no ""hidden plot twists"" or ""multi-level deeper meaning"" attached, quite frankly what you understand is what you get. This is because the game plays out like a children's storybook with you ""listening"" as someone is reading their adventures by a fire. I found myself enjoying it immensely because I grew up with Studio Ghibli, and it made me very nostalgic from start to finish. Many hundred of thousands of other gamers feel the same. 

Recently, the introduced a new patch that allows you to increase the difficulty of the game to Hard or Expert. One of the biggest criticisms of this game before was that the game was too easy and that the combat was over as soon as it began. The newer difficulties offer better rewards and gear for defeated enemies and will help balance the previous complaints of easy difficulty. 

Lastely, the overall feel of the game is something I just have to share with you guys on the fence. You guys already know my background that I wrote above - I really really really enjoyed this game. When I played RPG/JRPG's in the past, I normally skip through all of the dialouge between the charectors, voice acted or not, because I want to just play the game already. However, not once did I manage to skip any cut scenes or non acted voice lines, simply because the entire game packages the interaction so so well. There will be scenes where the main charactors talk about what they want to do next and you can't help but sit through the entire scene because you simply want to hear what everyone has to say - even if they don't say anything. There will be moments where there won't be any voice acting at all, and your forced to just click and read the entire scenario to advance to the next scene, but you find yourself doing it anyways simply because it's that immersive. The entire scenes are so well put together that it really draws you into it's world and it leaves an extreme lasting impression for when you are finished. You want to know what happens next when your done but the story is over - there are no more pages left in the book that the person is reading for you next to the fire. 

I personally highly recommend Ni no Kuni II to anyone on the fence. I have tried to be fair, that if you don't like what I said about the combat, or the way they decided to play out their story - do not buy this. I garantee you will not enjoy it and you will waste your money and end up writing a poor review. However, if the two above does not bother you at all, then buy it when you have the money and time. It's a game that's worth playing again for when you have kids old enough to want to play. It's that good.

20932413,WWE 2K19,49991425,"I just got the game when the digital deluxe edition was on sale for $30, when it's normally $90. At that price, there's no reason not to buy it. I've been holding out since I already own the last two games, and yearly released sports games can only advance so much each year. This didn't sound like a big enough update to 2K18, to spend $90 on. There's also some dumb choices like legends from previous games are not locked behind DLC for no other reason than they needed to fill out DLC spots for the Ric Flair edition. There's also some legends that didn't return for this game like Mick Foley and Mark Henry. Most baffling was current roster superstars that just weren't included at all like Nikki Cross.

As for playing the game, I do enjoy it, and so far it does feel like they've improved on the game play this year in quite a few ways. But it is a pretty buggy game. I didn't really have many problems in last year's game, a few glitches, but nothing severe. In my first match on 2K19, I already say glitchy lights on the way to the ring. Samoa Joe had a body horror contortion moment in the ring, and the ropes will go crazy sometimes. There's also random slow down, where the frame rate goes nuts for a few seconds at random times no matter how good your hardware is, but offline, it won't mess up your match. I'm not sure how they made this game more buggy than previous years. There also aren't many graphics settings, I'd imagine they're trying to simply and streamline it, where it's basic stuff like v-sync, resolution, and graphics low to high, it looks good, it's just there's no Nvida optimization, since it's just the basics. I wouldn't call it a lazy port or anything.

There is a massive roster. The deluxe does have all of the DLC included, and as usually you can go to a menu and unlock everything, or pick what you want unlocked. The game play does feel faster and more fluid this year. The commentary is still pretty off, like I'm stomping a guy, and Cole shouts ""vertical suplex!"" But the matches are very fun, and it does have all the production values of a WWE show, even if you select the unlockable arenas like a high school parking lot. Everything does it's best to emulate the WWE experience. It's very true to the formula of previous games, just a notch better, and enough to where it's worth getting, even if you've played enough of the last games that you were bored with them. My thing is, when it's on sale, like $20 for the base game and $30 for deluxe, get it. Just don't spend $60-90 on it, because at that rate, you might as well wait until later in 2019 for WWE 2K20 to come out for full price. While, there is plenty of complain about, it's by no means a bad game.

I honestly believe this is for the person who just wants to sit back, relax and explore.  If you do not like to explore and figure things out on your own, do not buy. If you need constant action, do not buy.  :) The game is what it is, a space exploration game, and it does deliver on that. 

As for the port, I can not comment, both my desktop and laptop run it with no issues. I am sure they are working on a fix, or at least I hope.

20369814,For Honor,64620890,"*Elevator door opens* Remember..... No Cheese.

 For Honor is not exactly a new game. Back then it was a unique take on the melee fighting genre.
 It was a very fun game to play but it had one massive issue before February of 2018, Peer-to-peer connections meant frequent connection issues on almost every game, in a game where mere milliseconds could mean the difference between defeat and victory, this networking system design was inexcusable.

Fortunately Ubisoft Montreal finally gave the game dedicated servers at the aforementioned date, and connection issues from their end were almost eliminated entirely. So the game made one of the biggest comebacks I've ever had the pleasure of witnessing. Let's get into the review per categories for maximum scrutiny :

GAMEPLAY :-
Well, this is the one thing the game got right since the start.  Fighting feels epic, unique to your playstyle and fresh with a current roster of 25 playable heroes. However this being a core pvp game it suffers from the same issue most other pvp-focused games have. BALANCE. While the heroes themselves are mostly well done, there is no question some overall kits are better than others. 
For example, Aramusha has a very feint-based kit but zero openers or stuns except on the full block counter (which needs more than the average brain to effectively use), means he greatly suffers in high-level play. 
He used to be my most played hero but as I got better I realized he desperately needs changes so I barely play him anymore.
Cheese exists in this game unfortunately. In 4v4 games lots of heroes have access to some ranged projectile they can throw that has no indicator to watch out for and removes half of your health instantly. IN A MELEE GAME.  The hitokiri can instantly kill you with her tier 4 feat which can be dodged but is incredibly hard to do so especially when you are already busy engaging another enemy.
I appreciate the game giving me tools to be able to fight more than 1 enemy simultaneously since people being dishonorable and ganging up on one target is inevitable, such as the revenge mode and extended iframes on successful block or parry.
You will enter matches on occasion where you will feel completely outclassed when the enemy absolutely shuts you down with light parries and almost feels like they're reading your mind, but ridiculous matchmaking errors like those are few and far between.

TLDR :- game can feel frustrating at times but otherwise is a fantastic experience.

STORY MODE :-  
Introduces one of the most badass villains you've ever seen, but then what the game decides to do with her is.......average at best.
Contains good cutscenes here and there but otherwise......meh. 
You will mostly play this story once or twice for completion and difficulty rewards and not touch it again.
Not that lack of a good story mode in a game like this hurts it that much to be honest.

CUSTOMIZATION :-
An aspect the game knocks out of the park. Each hero has 6 different customizable options. 3 for the armor the hero wears and 3 for the weapon the hero uses. And when each individual customizable piece has no less than 20 different options (though few of them will feel like recolors or reskins of others), there is still more than enough variety here to create your own personal badass ass-kicking champion. And it doesn't end at the appearances. Each hero also has a unique set of execution animations, emotes, end-of-game signature animations, and visual effects associated with each of the aforementioned. Across thousands of matches I've never seen the same hero twice, and I probably never will. 

MONETIZATION :-
Well handled as well.  All of the customization options I've just mentioned can be unlocked for free with in-game currency called steel.  You have 3 starter heroes and the rest is also unlocked for steel. Lots of heroes are bundled together by release date and purchased together with real life money but that's a convenience and NOT a necessity. Steel packs also exist as you would expect but since steel's rate of acquisition by simply playing the game and finishing daily quests is reasonable, I am not bothered by that either.  
The only content unobtainable by steel is the pve arcade mode, exclusive to the marching fire expansion for 30 euros. Heavily overpriced but an optional extra mode to test your skill against the best of bots the game has to offer.

SOUNDTRACK :-
Another aspect paid great attention to. Some of my most memorable soundtracks came from this game, although to be honest the last 3 seasons have suffered in this category if you ask me.

LABOR OF LOVE :-
The developers pay great attention to the players. New content (heroes and customizations) is releasing for the game fairly frequently. It's clear this project is one they take seriously and want to flourish.

COMMUNITY :-
There comes this random fight with a stranger who...wait...he's using the same hero I play! Wait he's even higher reputation with them than I am!  I demand a mirror match to see who plays the better!  I win this round!  Damn I'll get you next time!  (Repeat for at least 25 times).
And proceed to befriend this guy and kick ass with them in 2v2s and 4v4s.
Rinse and repeat the above every 50 duels. Considering one duel takes a few minutes, you're bound to make lots of friends as I have given the time.
For Honor memes and badass artwork exist, search the For Honor reddit. You're welcome.

Overall? A unique game I'm proud to own, no doubt. Frustrations arise here and there but the good times outnumber the bad times at least 10 to 1. But like most other games, it's damn near perfect but not quite.

9/10.

EDIT :-
Sorry but I'm taking the score down 1 points for the following reason :
- Absolutely broken matchmaking. If you ever think about trying a new hero when you're above account rep 60, good luck with that.

15832740,Total War: WARHAMMER II,62278734,"Total War: Warhammer II is one of my favourite games at the moment. Although I rarely have the time to play it these days, it still occupies my thoughts every now and then as I daydream of glorious battle and terrible magic, the forces of chaos, and the mighty empire. The world of Warhammer is fantastic on its own but with Total War, it has truly come to life. I'm not great at the game so I may not be the best person to say this but I feel like there's always more to be done and the challenge doesn't really ever fade, it just sort of changes. One moment you may find it hard to win battles because your armies are too weak, but further down the road, you may find that maintaining these armies are far harder than leading them to victory. Granted, I think the dwarves have a much easier time with that, they struggle in other areas. And of course, to all factions, the Chaos will present a nuisance at one point or another. Overall, I would definitely recommend for anyone who loves the world of Warhammer, strategy, magic systems or all 3 of these.",1579791363,1579791363,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198136599469,47,2,13216,0,11117

19752717,Hunt: Showdown,42041183,"Hunt: Showdown has a really good concept and really good ideas. Teams of two being dropped in a map full of normal and ""special"" zombies and you need to collect bounty, protect it from the other players and escape. Mostly It is really intense to survive and especially fighting against other players. I think that this game deserves a lot more players than right now but probably It will increase by time. 
-There are some optimization issues but It's not really a problem in gameplay right now, you can play it without a problem at least for me and my friend (not as bad as before).
-People say that zombies should be more difficult than now but in some intense moments they can create a really big chaos, especially in villages while you are trying to fight with other players.
-There should and will be more features like; characters, zombies, bosses, maybe maps and maybe in-game zombie kill count etc.
-I don't know If It ruins the idea or not but It would be good to try 3-4 players teams.

In conclusion, This is a really great game even right now. If you like intense games and zombie games you will absolutely like it. You will have fun with a friend because teams are made of 2 people or you can make a friend in game because you will need to talk with mic anyways. One of the most enjoyable co-op multiplayer games that I have ever played. Don't listen to those ""highly negative"" reviews because This game is a really good one.

I've been playing the campaign with a couple of good friends for the better part of a year.  After becoming invested in the characters and our stories and nearing the end of the third chapter, the game became almost unplayable due to glitches and crashes.  Just loading a previous save to begin a gaming session was an orchestrated effort requiring multiple reboots, using a workaround (entering Arena mode together, quitting, then joining the campaign), and holding our breath.

19588181,XCOM 2,20959806,"[h1] JOIN US OR BECOME THEM [/h1]

[h1] EDIT: Lack of optimization. The game is very poorly optimized. very. a lot. not good. [/h1]

I think I need to say this first, the game is awesome, but its optimization not. I press the ""automatically detect hardware recommendation"" the game set all the options on ultra... but the menus run with an important lag (10-15fps), when the ""action camera"" join the scene the fps experience a considerable decrease, about 20fps (but for example explosions or smoke looks perfectly during the game at 60 fps) so the game is poorly optimized at this point. I can run Wild Hunt for example on ultra on 60fps so... Think about it.

This is XCOM Enemy Unknown ultra enhanced edition. This is more and better. This is pure XCOM turn-based strategy. 
XCOM 2 is all the good things the original had (as well as the bad things too) with a lot of new stuff.

Now you are behind the enemies lines, XCOM becomes the underdog, acting furtively, in the shadows, they are now an organization declared criminal by the new order...  The time has come to reclaim our world. Now they are not fighting an invasion force, the XCOM project are now against a greater more organised force, with power and resources. And they are really pissed off with you. 
The new concepts, guerrilla tactics, the implementation of stealth, new enemies, a good variety of mission types, the customization of the weapons (you can add ons like scopes, lanterns, silencers,  enhanced ammunition... modify many aspects), of your soldiers (now you'll miss 'em when they die, if the moment comes... and trust me, surely come), can modify their aspect in a very deep way (but all the male faces are ugly as hell) there's a high level of customization. Your headquarter is really badass now. 
The maps are open now, you can move about the map freely, until you either stumble into range of an enemy or decide open fire on them, so, this is the guerrilla aspect of the game, you can now prepare an ambush, seek for the better positions before a gunfire or even almost end a fight before the enemies can react at your presence. but the situations can become in a different, very bad for you, scenario in a heartbeat, so you need a plan B, always.  
The combat feel so agil and natural. The game is very more dynamic this time. Fights are brutal, raw and complex. The game is really challenging and tough, doesn't forgive a mistake.
The environments are procedural battlefields, high-quality procedurally generated maps, there is slums, city centres, forest, suburban spaces, all interesting, richly detailed, destroyable (explosions can start fires that propagate, for example), interactives... (at this point maybe you got your suspicions... the game is amazing in every aspect!)
XCOM has a real evocative history now for the first time, with cutscenes, and remarkable characters with a backstory and its own opinions. People you want to save.
There are now Dark Events, and will change the game in unpredictable ways. Dark events are ""counter-operations"" undertaken by Advent against XCOM.
It's the more exciting turn-based tactical game ever made.

Of course it has its minor flaws, soldiers firing the same enemy during overwatch, missing high chance shots with an average of 87.3%... but we're here to suffer, weapons through walls, some glitches, ""weird walls"" when you enter in a building... but nothing really remarkable.
The graphics aren't spectacular neither the animations.
It's true that the game needs much better optimization, quite. I can run The Division beta or The Witcher 3 on ultra and 60fps but XCOM barely runs, on menus (yeah weird), about 20fps, in battle runs fine.

About mods and steam workshop. XCOM 2 has Steam Workshop support, this will improve the game in many ways and make it probably endless. Long War Studios (the team behind XCOM: Enemy Unknown's Long War overhaul) has already produced three mods for XCOM 2, all of which are playable from launch, highly welcome move! This feels like a free DLC because Long War Studios teamed up with developer Firaxis Games, and they've been working together!! so this mods perfectly fit with the core of the game, without problems or complications.

This game plays absolutely nothing like the previous FromSoftware games and has horrible mechanics to boot. You have no I-frames when dodging, deflecting (parrying basically) is inconsistent and enemies ignore it sometimes and queue up another attack immediately, there are about 4 different enemy types in the game (excluding bosses), your katana might as well be a butter knife for all its worth, and your character is made of tissue paper. On top of all of that, this game is the type to favor blunt difficulty over fun difficulty, and thus its definition of ""hard"" is spamming groups of enemies at you with bowmen making it utterly unfun to try to fight anything. The mechanic of breaking enemy posture to then be able to perform a killing blow is a cool idea, but the way it is executed makes the game extremely linear and boring as you spam the deflect button hoping to actually block something as that is more inconsistent than actually timing it.

The graphics are really good, and they include ultrawide support, however, there's no HDR , so 1440p is top resolution. (2k) - better than console tho - 1080p on XBOX one X and 900p on PS4 Pro. *sigh*.

My first ten minutes in the game, I was instructed to 'help yourself' to breakfast, by 'Mother'. I went to the table. Couldn't reach any item. Managed to get one apple. Sat at the table assuming i'd be able to eat. 'Not able to take items when sat down'. I then realised i could eat whatever was cooking in the 'pot' on the fire. Yet there was food on the table...

Went into the food store, in the starting house. 'Steal apples', even though they are my family's apples, anyway?! I could 'steal' 15, but i only wanted 1. I stole one but the entire batch of apples disappeared. This happened to any food i tried to steal.

Combat: ..is very hit and miss, literally. I couldn't hit anybody when they were lying down, or in the process of getting up. I couldn't hit anyone when they were opening doors.

Chasing someone - you lose stamina too quickly, so they generally get away, unless you can, with luck, workl out their run path and cut them off. (or catch them if they get stuck  by a tree or fence)

For me, the intial ten minutes and not being able to do what 'mother' tells me i CAN do, means i dont want to continue until it's been modded (mods need to be written), or they fix the issues to make it better than it is now.

Talking of mods. Lockpicking and saving isn't wonderful - lockpicking is tricky until you get the hang of it, so there's a mod to make it easier / remove it, already and to quick save you need 400 gold?! Really?! 400 gold?! yes. really. nexus mods have a mod that allows 10 saves / quicksaves. I'd get it if i were you.

-----
So many things about this series were fixed or outright removed in World.
The 240p resolution / 6th generation graphics from 2005 are gone & have *FINALLY* been replaced by very pretty 8th generation graphics. Gathering materials on the side is now quick and painless (no more consumable GATHERING TOOLS that take up additional inventory space). The maps are huge and now one giant instance (rather than being chopped up into dozens of loading screens). Changing gear, grabbing items you forgot or even mid-quest food buffs can easily be remedied by simply returning to camp (without having to restart the quest). The SoS system is great for drop-in / drop-out multiplayer*(more on that below). A HUGE portion of the game's combat nuances can be displayed in-game, via the new Hunter's Notes (you no longer need to keep a fanmade wiki page open to figure out stuff about monster weaknesses and such). Most weapon upgrades can be reverted, including the materials used for said upgrade being refunded. And because this is on PC, we have mods!
-----
It's not all perfect though..
There are still several issues with the game, some of which should not -BE AN ISSUE IN THE FIRST PLACE-.
This isn't the worst port of a console game I've seen, but for something that took 7 months ""To do ourselves, perfectly"", this is an underwhelming job. Through a certain Special K mod, its been shown that the game's engine attempts to make CPU drawcalls for up to 32 threads at any given time, severely crippling frame performance (unless you have the mod installed). Are you insane Capcom? Do you really think *EVERYONE ON STEAM* is rocking a Ryzen 1950X or i9-7960X? Those are $1000 processors!
While the idea of calling for assistance from anywhere in the world is nice, the stat scaling for monsters is jank. The moment another player is loaded into the quest, all large monsters gain a flat x2.5 HP/Stagger/StatusResistance. It does not matter if you're playing with two players or four. Its always x2.5 stats. This makes two-man hunts harder than they need to be, but three and four man hunts easier than they should be. Hammer and Hunting Horn users attempting to KO the monster are especially screwed because not only does the monster take nearly triple the number of head shots to get KO'd, but now you have said monster running all over the place to target each player. This is especially noticeable if the Hammer user is playing with someone using a Gun or Bow. Monster Stat Scaling is not reset back down to normal if all other players leave the quest (either disconnect, removed for negative behavior or just left on their own). I have seen players intentionally grief others by joining a newbie/novice's story quest just to trigger the Multiplayer Stat Scaling and immediately leave, making it harder for the host player.
Also, the FORCED REQUIREMENT of ALL players to watch or have already watched a mandatory cutscene before being able to just JOIN another player's Assigned Story Quests is very annoying. Especially so, if you're trying to play with buddies and they don't know WHERE to trigger the cutscene. You can't really help them, because you CANT JOIN UNTIL THEY TRIGGER THE CUTSCENE.
While the PC version does load immensely faster than the console versions (I bought the PS4 back in January, before the PC version came out in August), the Gathering Hub is unnecessary. There is MORE THAN ENOUGH ROOM to have all 16 players (in a Session) fit in Astera's lower hub. Just move some of the NPCs down there and make a second set of Food Tables. As it stands right now, no one goes up to the Gathering Hub unless its to run Arena Quests (which most players don't do anyway) or for the upcoming Kulve Taroth Quests. Every other Quest can be initiated / joined from Astera's Lower Hub anyway. What is the point of forcing the player to go through another load screen to get up to the Gathering Hub?

And what in the hell is going on with the PC's content scheduling? ""Accelerated rate of new content"" my @$$. We -KNOW- the files for DevilJho, Kulve, Luna, Behemoth and the Arch-Tempereds were already in the base game of the PC version on day 1. Stop drip feeding us.

- It's a fun co-op game to play with your friends, and you can build a nation with them and fight cool looking bosses. 
- If you don't have friends there are public servers you can join (official or not official ones)
- You can download workshop mods that can help you in your gameplay or just customize yourself as a different character. For example I get to be an anime waifu in game.


CON'S:
- None in my experience, but for my friends they had a hard time connecting but that would be their internet problem.

OVERALL:
I've always supported the DST game because it's fun a fun and interesting gameplay where the ultimate goal is to surviva as long as you can no matter what the world hits ya. It does seem easy at first but there are a lot of challenging elements in the game as it progresses. I'm telling you this now, this game is going to make you addicted and just have you playing it for hours and hours just to upgrade your base and explore the map to discover more landmarks and bosses. You can also install different types of mods in the workshop that can help you progress and just add some bonus stuffs to your game to make it more interesting. 

Also if you want to test your friendship I'd definitely recommend this game.

[b]Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay Mechanics[/b]
The story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover. 

The gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome. 

[b]PC Settings[/b]
Settings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well. 

The graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game. 

Side note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie. 

[b]Final Thoughts[/b]
To the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...

The ""Dark Souls"" comparisons are expected and (mostly) correct. 

Major Critiques:
-The environments are beautiful but they share a lot of the same color palettes and can get samey for a while. You can tell at a glance which area you're in based on the colors or music but the theme stays ""Gloomy"" all throughout. No Anor Londo here.
-Money. The money system is sometimes difficult and not in the fun way. If you die in an area you lose all your money and must return to the same area to get it back. If you die before you get it back it's gone forever. This isn't usually a problem except for the fact that if you die in an area it's either incredibly dangerous or in a boss battle so now you have to do the challenge you failed at AND try and get your money back from your ghost at the same time. You need a certain amount of money to progress but more importantly the DLC ""The Grimm Troupe"" introduces someone who will convert your broken upgrades into better versions. The only way to do this is with a massive amount of money you can only get through a massive amount of time grinding. No normal player will naturally get enough money for all three over the course of the game without grinding for it. The only collectibles other than the four or five upgrades in the game are ""artifacts"" that you can trade in to get money from an easily miss-able npc. These still aren't enough for the DLC upgrades.

Minor Nitpicks:
-Godmaster is a DLC for masochists. I did the final challenge with some bindings and I don't recommend it for most people. Locking an ending behind the super masochist challenge seems kinda mean, but you can always look it up on Youtube I guess.
-Near the very end of the game the fast travel system doesn't connect very close to certain areas and it makes traveling around the map a little tedious. The [spoiler]teleportation upgrade for the dream nail[/spoiler] doesn't really alleviate this. 
-Lore is incredibly vague even in the extra side content you would go out of your way for. If you want to know about the lore you really have to pay attention and have a degree in anthropology, or read up on a guide, or just go and watch Mossbag.

8261688,Hades,72954433,"Absolutely brilliant game. This is seriously impressive stuff, even more considering that the game is in early access ; this amount of content and polish is unheard of at this stage of development.
You play as Zagreus, son of Hades, prince of the Underworld. You try to escape Hell, climbing throught the ever-changing chambers of Tartarus.

 The pros:
-Fluid, enjoyable, sharp hack-and-slash gameplay. Fans of the genre will enjoy the delicate balance between the destruction of hords of weak enemies and the more careful phases around bigger ones. The game is easy to pick-up, with a good mechanical learning curve that will make your early progress that much more enjoyable
-Splendid graphics, featuring hand drawn portraits of gods and heroes, and very varied atmosphere and backgrounds. The game is easy to read in a glimpse (you never feel lost looking at your screen in the midst of battle) while retaining a distinct, elegant art style.
-Story wise, the game embraces the rogue-lite formula perfectly. The story progresses organically at each respawn, advancing with the player's interactions with its surroundings. The ""one-more-game"" itch remains even between games, for you want to explore and know more about the world and the different inhabitants of hell.
-Voice acting : every single line by every single character is voiced. The amount of voice acting is seriously incredible : I have fought the same boss 13 times and not once did it greet me with the same dialog. This makes the world feel alive, progressing with each failed attempt at escaping hell.
-Gameplay variety : 6 weapons are available, with radically different style and upside: a bow, a shield, a cursed cannon... this helps make each run feel unique. Furthermore, you receive different boons from all the Olympic gods that spice up your gameplay, making you more powerful in some aspect every time
-In 12 hours or so, I have yet to encounter a single bug or typo. The polish is amazing for a in-development game.
-Many other things

The cons:
-Sometimes, the game freezes a bit during level transition and dialog boxes. Nothing too serious, it doesn't happen during fights, and the game is still in early access.
-Thats about it?

Final word: 10/10

I'm playing through Divinity 2 with two of my best friends who I live a good distance from. This is the closest thing to capturing the magic of a great D&D campaign in video game form that I have ever found (in terms of the feeling I get). We only get to play once or twice a week together but we all look forward to Divinity night! 

The graphics are a nice upgrade over the first D:OS. The combat is tactical and we really have to think during each battle (we are playing on hard difficulty). One can tell that a tremendous amount of detail, love, and hardwork went into this game. There is an incredible attention to detail. One of my friends and I are software developers and we marvel at how much work/coding must have went into the dialogues, for example, -- little things like an NPC saying he couldn't help us when one person initiated a conversation because that person didn't have the required item but then we gave that person the required item in the middle of the interaction and the NPC was smart enough to realize this and adjusted their dialogue accordingly.

Can’t recommend this game enough if you’re a fan of good oldschool RPGs with some modern flare.

For the game to flex its muscles you really need to deck it out with all the expansions which then turns it into an expensive game.

Personally I have found almost no bugs with Fallout 4 as compared to other Bethesda games. What few bugs I found were easily solvable with a simple console command. Though the game is not perfect I prefer to enjoy the game for what it is and not get overly whiney about issues that the diehard crowd might. Yes the game is more of a ""shooter"" than Fallout 3 but I rather enjoyed the feeling of immersion into the world rather than the relatively clunky feeling I had with 3 (though I loved Fallout 3 and played it for many hours on console). If becoming more of a shooter is what it took to make it feel as smooth as it does in Fallout 4 I don't mind a bit. Combat in general feels much smoother and more seemless. I love the art-style of Fallout 4; it gives a good visual mix of the pre-war world and still shows the wreckage and destruction of the world today after nuclear annihilation. Fallout 3 in comparison was purely a destroyed wasteland with little to nothing worth looking at especially not the two-tone color scheme. One last part of Fallout 4 that I thouroughly enjoy is the settlement system. Though not perfect, it gives you a feeling of having a home of your own the way you want it and a place to drop all your gear and refresh your character. I love the power armor system being something more than another set of armor but rather a system of its own. Last but not least, I enjoy weapon customization to my playstyle and the fact that I no longer have to find other guns of the same type to constantly repair my guns (which became annoying).

Fallout 4 brought a lot to the table that I had hoped for after playing Fallout 3 and is worth a try to say the least...",1447314690,1475646412,True,3,0,0,True,False,76561198076780111,396,23,21060,0,19979

17288162,Fallout 4,21332825,"This is a remade review, my old one was filled with more ire then anything else and after much reflection of why I despised (and still do) fallout 4, I think i've finally found the reasen why I hated it so much. 

I have been reading the comments and the reviews on steam for a while now. My opinion of the game is negative but I've been forcing myself to read the positive comments as much as I can, no matter how sever they are to the negative comments nor how temperamental I get towards their opinions which I feel miss the point.  My conclusion of why I believe so many people like fallout 4 and why so many hate it is because its different without being different. Basically, everything the game does is done by many other games but it doesn't add its own spin on it nor does it do it as well. Its basically a cut and paste job. 
                    This would be fine if it didn't have the Fallout logo on it and if it wasn't made by Bethesda which are both known be RPG oriented. The lack of true RPG, the ability to truly make your character your own which has been a fundamental design stone for the Fallout franchise, has been stripped away not to make the game different but to make it more of the same. This is why, I believe, so many people are at odds with it while simultaneously so many people are enthralled by it. It is for the reason that the game didnt stay true to what made it different that I just can not recommend it to anybody. Simultanously, I cant recommend it to anybody who plays just for the gameplay simply because the gameplay itself isnt that different (or better) then any other FPS out thier either.
          Final conclusion: Play FarCry 3, Borderlands, Mad Max, Mass effect, Dragon age, Doom, Call of Duty, Diablo, Minecraft, ect., ect., ect.  you will be far more enthralled with those games then you will be with this one.

12243820,BioShock Infinite,12724011,"Having recently played the first installement and left feeling disappointed, I was cautiously optimistic going into Infinity. I'm happy to say I liked this one quite a bit. It definitely felt more modern, fluid and less stiff than I was afraid it could be, what Bioshock 1 was.

I think the strongest part of Bioshock Infinite is the setting, lore and atmosphere. It's just fantastic! And beautiful. It makes for a pleasant journey through the whole game. Tied into this is the story, which when looking back, is pretty damn good. But the story doesn't really engage or feel interesting in-game until the last act - where up until that point, you've basically destroyed a whole city and massacred its population; justified only by a vague mission to pay of a gambling debt. It doesn't feel right throughout the major part of the game. Speaking of the story, the characters are pretty good. Especially Elizabeth feels well written, with depth and personal development going forward in the story. The main character however, feels generic and shallow in comparison. It is not until the ending we finally get to see at least some depth and character in Dewitt.

On the flip-side, there were also some things I didn't like about the game.  Most tie in with the combat and Elizabeth's role in it. It generally felt too easy. Hard should never be not difficult, especially as a player new to the Bioshock series playing Infinite for the first time. But it was. The main problem, I felt, was the revive mechanic which I absolutely loathed!  When dying, istead of having to try again and changing your tactics to ultimately win an ecounted - with the revive mechanic it's simply a a matter of wearing the enemies down; die, revive (with ammo and often in a room seperate to the combat area with additional ammo and other goodies to boot!!), kill some more enemies and repeat until victorious. And the way that Elizabeth tosses health packs and ammo when you most need it also makes it significantly easier. These things take a lot of the challenge out of it, unfortunately. I mean, the actual combat was often pretty challenging on hard, but thanks to these mechanics, utlimately too easy. The revive mechanic especially has the consequence that you never really get better at playing the game, you never change or develop your tactics - simply because you don't have to, because it's always only a matter of wearing the enemies down. I also don't really like the way you only have two vigors active on your hud, when it doesn't really matter because changing vigor is as easy as clicking 1-8. I often found it confusing because I wanted to change vigor mid-combat and in that hectic moment didn't remeber which vigor corresponded to which vigor. I wished they had a bar with all vigors and just highligted which one was active, or somthing similar - though this is a minor complaint.

Overall I'd say I was pleasantly surprised by Bioshock Infinite. It was much more fun than I had thought, with a fantastic setting and matching atmosphere - slightly offset by mechanics making the combat too easy and often tedious.",1414847145,1416755491,True,0,0,0,False,False,76561198021785684,136,6,1598,0,1598

13923917,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,72676874,"You're either playing this or fortnite so I think you know what you're getting yourself into. For me, there's steep learning curve and it can be hard to compete in games like this, that sometimes leave you wandering around for an eternity only to be killed by the first person you come in contact with. I think if you're considering buying this, you need to make sure you like these kinds of games before spending any money. Despite the stigma that surrounds fortnite, it could give you a little bit of an idea of how these battle royale games work at a $0 entry fee. If you like that and you want to feel like you're playing something that isn't designed for 12 year old's, you'll like this.  

Personally, the whole battle royale thing isn't for me, it gets me too dang anxious and I get frustrated at spending a lot of time on the maps only to be dumped on by somebody who is clearly much better at this than me and then having to start the process of finding a new match, wandering around for 5 minutes or dying immediately and the cycle goes on. But, if you're more than just a casual gamer and you are willing top put forth the time it takes to get used to the game then by all means, this is the battle royale to play. 

I do hold issue with microtransactions regardless of the form, which every game seems to have a version of these days, but this isn't a huge issue as spending real world money isn't really going to help you be better at this.

3156411,Cube World,55359171,"This game is good, but could be better. 
We were promised so much from the alpha. This is just a few that we could have gotten
More skill trees. This version. Nothing new
More classes. This version? Nothing
More races. This version? Nothing at all.
And that's just more of what we were ""promised"" Now to show my thoughts
Gameplay feels smooth and the game looks really nice. So much better looking than the alpha, but thats just how the game looks. 

-Artifacts. This on paper seems fine, but region locking on some seems weird and not fun to get in every region. 
Reigns, Boats, and Hang Gliders should not be region locked. Everything else is fine. I feel like that if the region lock You're so slow other wise and traveling is tedious and instead of killing mobs which is useless in this version of the game. You're  walking aimlessly hoping to see an npc to tell you where to go, and if you don't find any npcs that do that. Then you're forced to explore which seems silly. I would do that on my own while i'm killing things, but since killing things don't matter exploring is forced and I don't like that at all. 

-Equipment Equipment is the end all be all in most games like this, and getting the best equipment possible so you can blaze through the game is what make games like this fun. IMho, but in this region lock makes that so dumb.. Because you need to do the ""quests"" and most of the quests are near impossible without the right equipment. If you were to make it easier to get equipment then region lock would be OK. Like, say from mobs then killing mobs would actually mean something! Green mobs should have a higher chance of dropping equipment. White mobs should have a higher chance of dropping equipment. Blue mobs should have a higher chance of getting blue equipment, and especially for your class. It's disappointing to get equipment for the wrong class. Especially if i'm playing solo which is mainly what I do.

Otherwise farming for equipment from only quests, which i'll talk about in a bit. Seems tedious and unfun. I played for about 6 hours and it wasn't till i did quests. I started getting equipment for my class... Hello? That doesn't seem right at all.
(I've played for about 12 hrs or so btw) so half a day

Questing: Questing is so dumb in this. Why? Because all you do is walk around like aimlessly hoping an npc can tell you where to go, and they almost never spawn, and to top it off. All the ""friendlys"" as ppl tend to call em are mainly just the roaming ones, and the only real npcs that give u quests are the one in the towns. Which makes sense, so basically you have to find most of the stuff by exploring. Which again, seems silly to me.
Also, why is there no quest log? If you want questing to be a thing. That's fine, and that's great. The alpha had no real incentive so this is actually quite nice and fun, but to find the quests is ridiculous. I think a quest log could be great and  fix a lot of the issues of questing in this game. The questing seems even more tedious and grindy.

-Overall. If you're new. You've got nothing to lose. Game is so cheap and you're supporting a passionate indie game dev, but if ur an alpha player like me, You'll slowly go insane trying to play this game, and trust me at first you'd be like ""Oh, this game is great!"" Then after playing you'll realize how flawed this version is. It has a long way to go, and feels half assed. So rushed. LIke he realized suddenly after 6 years, Wait, I still have a game to complete! And rushed this out. I mean, that's fine and i'm glad he actually released it, but this version is not good, and there's many other things that i could say, and wollay if you do actually read these. Please take a look at what we have to say. This is for the longevity of your game, and we want this game to succeed. You could merge the two systems together, get rid of region lock equipment, and you'd 'be great honestly. I'd be so happy, but for now this game is as hard pass for me as an alpha player. Peace out Cube World Fam. Hope you all enjoy the game!

b) Full of confusing/convoluted gameplay & instructions (lack thereof)
c) Zero forgiveness for new players interpretation of (vague) instructions 

I spent 10 hours deciding if I liked this game - or not - and after 'claiming' a crashed ship that was part of the story line I lost use of my original ship without warning. Upon exiting this new ship I learned had lost my original save data - preventing me from rectifying the situation. 

Besides a terrible second impression -- I wanted to like this game - it has everything I would want open world, space, base building - but unlike Rust, 7 Days to Die, The Forest, etc. it is devastatingly shallow. Inb4: Those games are shallow too - Those games also dont boast 'infinite galaxies & possibilities'.

The tutorial is a ridiculous hand holding 'adventure' where you quickly realise that every aspect of this game from planet #1 is a carbon copy with a different dress slapped on it.  

I would highly recommend you STAY AWAY from this incredibly overpriced shit-heap until they have a finished product - or just find a batter game to play.

EDIT: For those of you saying the developers are doing the community a favour for all of the free content - the game is $60 dollars or $30 at 50% off - STOP LETTING DEVELOPERS GET AWAY WITH PUTTING OUT SHITTY GAMES.

Short version: it's not really playable at the moment. Too many bugs, crashes and lag.

Here's another concern - the game as it currently stands upon early access release seems quite bare bones, lacking depth; seems to be just a basic survival game with a Conan skin. Looking at the official website at the 'what's next for Conan Exiles' page (https://blog.conanexiles.com/en/whats-next-conan-exiles) there is a couple of MINOR additions planned... and nothing else listed. Plus, the early access description says it will be in EA for less than 12 months. 

I think it's fair to say this game could be great - but it would need big new features, added depth, infusion of lore/story and... more personality and killer gameplay opportunities. 

Based one what I can see, there is no real roadmap. No (visible) plan. And the new features appear to be tinkering around the edges. If that's all it will be... I will (very regretfully) have to pass.

It is obvious that there will be problems but are they not with most games? I haven't played Assassin's Creed Black Flag AT ALL !!! Even being computer specialist I couldn't make it run on my system and believe me I've tried everything all Internet offers. And you complain abut this????? What about the rip off with Elder Scrolls Online???? 60 pounds lost on wretched alpha ugly and unplayable game that is still on market. Here I find lots of good points and efforts. Try to be less judgmental and blame Yourselves for falling for all this hype that wasn't even created by Halo Games but all these internet trolls/youtubers. It is well spent money and good game - not great but good with lots of potential and I can easily give studio credit they will fulfill some of promises if not most. Good Job Lads!!!

It gets repetitive after some time but that is NOT any different to what studio was saying. I tried to play many games with console style controls and it was unsuccessful. This game is way better than most of them. 

Can You make a game that covers lot of mechanics this game does and expect it to work flawless on everything? If not - stop whining! 

I died killed by pirates and this is usually a breaking point in most games that I am not certain if they are ok to play. Guess what? Still playing!

Graphics look very good - keep in mind you have natural size planets!!!!!!!!!!! And no constant loading!!!!!!!! That is an achievement!!!!!!!

Voices are ok. I thought this announcing vioce will be a nightmare for me - but somehow it is not - I've got accustomed to it. Music is not annoying (which IS IMPORTANT!), other effects are well made. Nothing to complaint.

People were expecting game of groundbreaking scale and immeasureable possibilities. How come? Where from? Get a grip people! You are easily rigged by your own imagination on top of laziness of XXI century society of always complaining and whining creatures.

Filter it and You will see that nothing unexpected happened here and accept it. You will be content with what You got. 

If you do not like it - maybe next time THINK! before making a purchase???

I can say one thing. 
Studio could expect that people are generally stupid and will follow everybody and everything if it gets popular enough nowadays... 

So they did a mistake of not letting this game be alpha/beta tested in what case I AM SURE game would have been much more polished and free of reported problems.

This will change now as Hello Games seems to be responding nicely to all of this ruckus.

One last thing You may not grasp. How can You know that this way was the only possible for studio to be able to finish doing game? To finance it and let out as soon as possible risking this what happened? Nobody will tell you this but You cannot be sure it these times that it is quite likely to be.

Good playing!



PS 
The only complaint I have is that this preorder ship is just nothing special at all. I have changed it after having a chance to see 20 slots ship. It was forced by game mechanics that force you to increase slots or keep struggling... This really could be changed because I feel a bit ripped off by this. 

And uncommon oxides are ONLY ones that you can recharge your shield with - this is another putting off mechanics as You cannot use abundant Iron but others are scarce but You need them alot since beggining because of being attacked - that's why i died because I havent got enough zinc or titanium to recharge shield.

15632122,Monster Hunter: World,46136350,"TL;DR - The graphics and gameplay make this game the best in the series and you won't regret picking it up and playing with your friends or making new friends.

I have been a huge fan of MH since the PSP days.  Since then, I've seen this series evolve both in a positive and negative way.  All the monsters added, all the new areas to explore, each new title in the series brought me back to hunting and crafting my way to the top.

MH:W has changed the series, but in my opinion, it's for the better.  Simplifying a bit of the mundane or difficult parts of the series helped to bring in people who were shy about it.  A steep learning curve mixed with a super dedicated fan base would have been off-putting for me had I not already dipped my toes in long time ago.  I feel these changes would likely have brought me into the series, or at least really into this game.

The graphics, the gameplay, the new helpful tools and a revamp to the controls really ensnared me into this game.  I have only 29 hours on PC, but I own the PS4 version (yes I am the fanboy who buys a copy for each console) and I have sunk so much time into it.  I do think the PC version is a ton better than the console versions.

Also, the fact that they FINALLY brought the series back to consoles AND put it on PC, that had me roped in right away.  It was so much better when it wasn't just handheld.  The 3DS ports and versions were good, don't get me wrong, but the world in MH:W just shows how great a masterpiece these guys can make.

With all that said, this game gits a big YES for recommendation and I hope you will enjoy it as well.",1542856193,1542856193,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197981635690,576,8,6171,693,1597

20945551,Thief Simulator,61900889,"Basic Info - Thief Simulator is one of my favorite 'Simulator' styles games by far! I love most of the story, and plenty of the in-game mechanics. I'm absolutely in love with the game's 'Dark Web' mechanic for purchasing your gear online, it's not hard to find what you're looking for, not too busy/tacky, and very direct. (Black Bay, if I'm remembering correctly.)

I haven't put too many hours into this game, as I completed the story and robbed all the houses pretty quickly, making me BORED OUT OF MY MIND trying to find cool new things to do. However, I really did enjoy the time I spent playing the game. For the price, 110% worth it.

PROS ~ 
You don't need a crazy good/expensive computer to enjoy the game.
The tutorials are very thorough, and won't leave you confused.
The HUD isn't annoying or in the way.
LOTS of mechanics for theft + overall fun.
Easy controls.
Nice graphics.

CONS ~ 
The game can get repetitive/boring after you beat the story.
Neighborhood(s) are typically small/lacking in any cool easter eggs or challenges.
The in-game police aren't very good, a simple collision in a police chase will have you arrested, and, coming to close to an alert officer will end with you being tased and brought into custody instantly. GAME OVER...

You begin with an empty ranch, with no adorable friends occupying the area, and end with so many different types of slimes hanging around to interact with. The game is a bit of a simulation game, where you manage the slimes, food, and plorts (produced when you feed slimes) to keep the slimes happy and make lots of Newbucks! 

There has been so much added content to the game since it's release, with new areas and items being introduced every update. My two favorite parts of the game would have to be the jetpack (you can essentially fly for short period of time!) and the adorable way that the slimes interact with you, be it just bumping into you or jumping onto your head. 

A word of advice: make Saber Honey slimes, you won't regret it. They are, by far, the cutest Large slimes in my opinion.",1548005339,1548005813,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198316493963,59,2,11912,0,8517

Far Cry 5 is making use of the Dunia Engine. The Game is currently one of the best looking games you can buy out there, with a huge Open World  amazing lighting, lots of trees and moutains with great detail and overall nice world design. Character Models do look nice in game but look a lot better during cutscenes. Textures are Sharp and the water effects are very good too. Sounds are pretty high quality too, character voices are loud and understandable, car sounds do sound good enough and gun shots do sound nice too. Overall this is one of the best looking games in 2018.

[*][h1]Gameplay:[/h1]
Mostly this is your classic Far Cry Open World gameplay with a couple of key changes. I did notice that they added a Squad / buddy command option just like in Tom Clancy's Wildlands you can control you Squad / buddy. Now you have to unlock sectors ( underbosses ) just like in Tom Clancy's Wildlands. They ditched the Climb the Tower to unlock the map crap and now you just explore the map which is an improvement in my opinion. Lastly you can start fishing which is a pointless addition in my opinion. The AI is extremely underdeveloped, they rarely change positions and mostly just stand in the middle of nothing. Still it is a very fun game to play despite its flaws.

[*][h1]Story:[/h1]
There will be no Spoilers, or not any major ones atleast.
Considering the setting the game had they missed out on a great story, you barely remember any characters as the game intoduces so many of them in such little time that you just forget the previous one. Cutscenes are well made especially the opening scene is extremely well made but other than that you just get confused, and lastly you just get a very weird ending , something totally unexpected. This section of the game isn't the strongest part!

[*][h1]Performance :[/h1]
It was only tested on a High End Device ( Intel core i7 4790k & Nvidia GTX 1070 ) which was running at Ultra settings with 60 to 70 fps 1080p.
It probably runs on Mid Range devices too ( AMD FX-6300 & GTX 760 ) i will update the review when is test it again.
I had no crashes in 23 hours of gameplay., but the game was freezing a couple of times!

[b][ 7,5 out of 10 ][/b]

[*][h1]Multiplayer :[/h1]
Multiplayer is exactly like Far cry 4. I would recommend Co-oP and to play it with a friend as the game is extremely fun in that way. You won't have problems finding other online players either as the games does have a healthy playerbase.

[*][h1]Price :[/h1]
The Game is still rather new so you will not find it under 30 yet. Considering the amount of content it has it is an okay deal in all honesty.

[*][h1]DLC :[/h1]
DLCs are overpriced with very little contnet in my opinion and you should wait for a lower price.

Let me start by saying that this game is - at least in my opinion - far better than Insurgency. Something about the small, well made maps and most of the players having a rifle makes for amazing gameplay.
Teamwork and communication is vital to gaining victory. Be careful when you speak though, as the enemy can also hear, if close enough!
From storming the beaches of Normandy, keeping your head down in the snowy trenches of Bastogne, and fighting in the sunlit streets of Italy and Greece, this game has it all. Whilst you are skirmishing with the enemy, your officers (in conjunction with radio operators) will call fire support in the form of smoke and HE artillery barrages, spitfire gun-runs, bombings, and more.

There are also tactical destructible elements to the game. This element consists of destructible walls, that, when destroyed by the demolitions class, will allow your team to move freely to another area of a map that previously they might have been restricted from. This can lead to flanking tactics not seen in Insurgency and most other shooters. All throughout my hours of play, I have not noticed any weapons being over-powered in any way, as each weapon serves a purpose and has a weakness.

The one area this game does not do so well on is the graphics and movement. Because this game runs on Source, the movement can often be a bit fumbly, and thus gets you stuck on walls, corners, ect. Then there is the graphics. The graphics aren't bad, or ugly, but they certainly aren't great, though they serve their purpose well. Low resolution terrain textures and generally grainy textures caused by the source engine starts to show the engine's age, but so long as you can ignore that, the game can still be fairly pretty.

Overall this is one of my favourite games, and I would give it a strong [u]8/10[/u] for the team play, polished shooting, fantastic maps and map design, and reasonable price (UK £14.99/US $19.99 as of the writing of this review) .

Sane Trilogy,43195639,"Nostalgia aside, this remake (and I will say remake, because despite the content being based upon the original, it IS built from the ground up, which is what makes it even more impressive) proves that simple platformers still hold up in 2018. At his least, Crash can jump and spin. At his most, he can double jump, body slam, slide, sprint, and shoot a bazooka. In both circumstances, he is smooth to control.

The few gripes I have are these:

Crash isn't QUITE as responsive here as in the originals. Specificially as his moveset expands; in Crash 2 and Warped, you can't crouch and jump immediately like the originals to get a higher jump. You must stop, crouch, hold on for a brief second, and then jump. That doesn't make a huge difference but it definitely is a downgrade.

The graphics are beautiful, but they lose some of the charm with this high fidelity. Some things are too smooth, or too clean in color. This is especially notable in Crash: Warped, because the environment changes so much more drastically than the other two games. This is mostly a taste thing, so it's less of a critique than it is a personal issue.

The optimization is mostly good, but if your screen is less than 1080p you're gonna have to screw around with the menu blind in order to get it to a resolution where you can see. This is because the game is set to open windowed, not fullscreen, at 1920x1080. Just get past the title screen to where you can select between the three games, and press down once to get to the options for any of the games. The graphics options affect all three games across the board, and the resolution is one of the first choices, so it's an easy fix with a little intuition. 

All in all, I recommend this to old fans who played the originals, I recommend this to new fans, I DEFINITELY recommend this to anyone looking for a tight platformer. It's good, and that's without the nostalgia goggles.",1530386671,1530386671,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561198040145973,181,2,2744,0,531

Allow me to tell you why this isn't an issue and that it's fine for there to be DLC.

Firstly, the core game has been in development for some time. This isn't just getting the game to work, this is patching in fixes & releasing new content continuously over an extended period of time. These people worked hard.

Secondly, if it wasn't labelled as early access, nobody would know or care. You could play Ark from day one of it's release on steam and although it'd have had a couple of glitches and need a bit of polish, no one would complain. It was a fully functioning and fun game and continues to be so.

Thirdly, support for the core game hasn't been completely dropped. Servers are still up, patches are still coming in and there is new content being released as well.

Honestly, I don't see where the problem is. It doesn't feel like the core game has suffered for having DLC. I can understand there being some disappointment that not everything new is going to be free but I really like the idea of adding a new biome and I think it's fresh and different enough to be justifiably chargeable under these circumstances. It's also not that expensive. Just enjoy ARK for what it is! A really good survival game with RPG elements and FREAKING DINOSAURS!

3124666,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,57872722,"Without giving away spoilers, a number of characters are killed throughout the campaign. Given these characters weren’t from previous installments in the series, I didn’t have as much of an attachment to them like I do with characters such as Soap MacTavish and Captain Price. I loved the banter between characters in Infinite Warfare and when some of them were KIA, there were some characters I was sad to see die, and others happened so quick you had to move on. There is a very good feature to deal with these deaths in the form of notes to loved ones that you can read on a computer in your Commander’s station on the Retribution. Some of them hit me right in the feels as they had messages to their children, while others gave me more insight into those characters. I thought this was a really fitting touch considering you’re the Commander of your troops.

I completed the campaign in 9 hours and loved every minute of it. The way they did the credits was incredible, allowing you to listen to final messages to the families from some of the key characters that didn’t make it. Got me right in the feels again, and I was also surprised to see that the main writer was Brian Bloom himself. Once the credits rolled, two new difficulty levels for the campaign mode were made available – Specialist, and #YOLO. The Specialist difficulty is meant to be as realistic as possible in terms of the damage inflicted on you and your enemies. For example, you will lose your helmet if it is destroyed by enemy fire, causing you to instantly die while in space or from a single headshot. You will also lose the ability to control your arms if you are damaged by an enemy, making aiming down sights incredibly difficult while losing the ability to use Tactical and Lethal equipment. Your health will not regenerate, however you can heal yourself by using nano-shots and helmets located throughout the campaign. The #YOLO difficulty is an Ironman-style, very similar to Specialist difficulty, with the key difference being that if you die, you will have to start the entire Campaign over (harsh!).

As is the case with most Call of Duty games, Infinite Warfare comes with a solid Zombies mode. I thought they would utilise some of the actors from the campaign, however the “Zombies in Spaceland” mode has it’s own stars with Ike Barinholtz, Jay Pharoah, Seth Green and Sasheer Zamata. These actors play the main Zombies characters of AJ, Andre, Poindexter and Sally, battling hordes of crazy undead in an 80’s abandoned theme park. However, the big names don’t stop there. We also came across Pee-wee Herman (Paul Reubens) as well David Hasselhoff as his Knight Rider character Michael Knight which was really cool to see. Other zombie maps also feature appearances from Jay and Silent Bob actors Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, as well as Pam Grier, Cassandra Peterson and Fred Tatasciore.

If you haven’t finished the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare campaign, or are yet to play it, do yourself a favour and pick it up next time it’s on sale. I rate this story up there with some of the best in the series, and the gameplay, visuals and music were amazing. The story was emotional and I love that about these Call of Duty campaigns.",1574779807,1574779807,True,0,0,0,False,False,76561197960576941,970,38,540,0,540

I am yet to play it thouroughly, but I can say already that this seems another step in the right direction. And for the (nearby) future, improvements regarding trade and espionage are planned as well, so this makes me happy as well, so I think I can now recommend the game. There are still improvements to be made, but I have confidence that Paradox will deliver truly great mix of 4X and Grand Strategy someday.

---

UPDATE April 2017: Okay so about a year later we have some patches and a mayor DLC and the state of the game is much improved. Their are still many things missing or weird and I encountered still quite some bugs with questlines and AI behavior, but all things considered the game is getter better slowly. I had quite some fun, but the price of the DLC and the bugs and imbalances still force me to a ""thumbs down"" for now. However, if Paradox improves combat soon this might very well change into a ""recommended"" in the nearby future.

Original review: A few months and some patches and DLC later, this game will probably be a 4X game nearly as good as MoO2. But for now, it is dreadfully shallow. It starts great however: race customization is fun, early exploration is exciting, not in the least because of some good writing for some event chains. The game looks good, the soundtrack is also a great, somewhere in between Mass Effect 1 and Interstellar. But as mentioned in many other reviews, both of users and journalists: once you hit mid-game, the stream of nice events dries up and what's left is a grand strategy-light with braindead AI.

Luckily, Paradox promised to fix most of the stuff, like the wonky AI, in patches soon to come, so there remains hope. And there is also hoping they will add lots of stuff in DLCs and free updates, for example""
- Intrigue, espionage and diplomatic missions, both inside other empires and inside your own realm
- A (civilian) trade mechanism which you can influence, pirate of blockade (a la Civ5 perhaps)
- More uniqueness between the (randomized) races, factions and empires, because now the differences are mainly superficial.
- More Science Fiction tropes: where are the doomsday weapons, the artifical planets, the living ships, the race to post-humanism, cybernetics, temporal technologies, cloaking and stealth ships, space trees, alien diseases, etc etc.
- Fleshed-out characters with motivations which may not always align with your own, somewhat like CK2
- Faction-play inside your empire that becomes way more important, especially mid-game
- Better combat: at least let us set a rule of engagement of some form of simple formation
- ... and other stuff I cannot even think of yet :)

12589196,Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc,22506541,"This review will be free of story spoilers because really that's what you should be here for, the story.  So far I've played 999 and its sequel and Danganronpa and I'm sitting here writing this waiting on Danganronpa 2 to unlock (5 more hours).

THE STORY

The storytelling is the reason to play any game by Spike Chunsoft.  This isn't just a bit of fluff either, where drops of water in a desert taste sweeter, with the trappings of an epic tale (but still lacking some intangible element).  No.  The developers here have a keen sense for what makes stories compelling and have obviously worked hard to make those guidelines apply within the boundaries specific to the video game as a unique medium.

I used to be in agreement with Roger Ebert who famously once said that video games couldn't be art.  The very nature of storytelling itself is at odds with the inherent nature of gameplay -- one demands that we examine choices taken and the other demands that we have some sembelence of choice ourselves.  This is what made Bioshock so compelling and successful and indeed the only other example of great storytelling in the medium, because the developers understood this tension between traditional storytelling norms and the specific constraints placed on them by the medium they're working in.

THE GAME

If you're in it for the story then great!  The gameplay is fun too, but you should know up front that all the Spike Chunsoft games (or at least the ones I've played) are more like a storybook with a game attached.  If you're afraid that might mean the gameplay is a second thought then don't run off just yet.  The story is absolutely the prime focus here and takes up the lion's share of 'gameplay' time but the game aspect is crucial and, for my part, extremely well developed.

It's not a secret that Danganronpa was developed as a graphical novel first and then gameplay was developed to add to it but, without giving too much away here, the gameplay seems like it was designed with the meaty aspects of the storytelling in mind.  I mean, I don't know, but for the themes that the story was trying to get across I felt the gameplay reinforced those themes in a way that made it more real feeling than simply reading it would (or listening to the voice acting, as it were) and I find it easy to believe that this was every bit intentional.

GAMEPLAY

Practically speaking there are 3 parts of the game:  Story time, exploration/friend making, and investigations/trial.  If you're not listening to the actors or moving between stages you're walking around the school and ""making friends"" or you're looking for clues and then participating in a trial.  The friendship building sub-game earns you powerups you can use during the trial phase and requires you to find/earn special coins to randomly obtain items that you'll have to figure out which person likes and give it to them at the right time -- overall I didn't like this aspect too much but it's easy enough to look things up online and I found that it didn't venture too deep into spoiler territory; it's forgettable but also interesting to hear the deeper backstories of the different players.

The trial has different phases and mini games.  Some are more or less frivolous but not without purpose; they allow for a pacing that lets the trial build and build to a big climax.  With decent twitch skills on the PC you could easily set both difficulty settings to high; one makes it a little more difficult to click targets (I think it increases reticle drift and the amount of blocking 'blue text' items that appear), the other gives you more options to select between when trying to resolve a question.

THE MOOD

I figure if you still aren't sure if you want the game or not you're not sold on the gameplay (which, again, is really fun but supportive of the story rather than the other way around) and you may need to know what the game feels like.  Some people may find it kind of a spoiler but I figure it's unavoidable if you need to know about the mood, right?

So, -spoiler warning- etc.  Although not really.

The setting of Danganronpa is similar to Battle Royale or The Hunger Games -- a situation that pits young adults/children against one another in a zero sum fight to the death.  The rules for Danganronpa are a more patient, however, and the game plays out more like a series of whodunit cases where the trial determines the perpetrator of a murder.

Thanks to strong character development you'll find yourself with affections for the characters, carefully developed, until they betray you in some way.  The roller coaster of emotions is evocative of Game of Thrones in that it seeks to build you up only to tear you back down again.  Only difference here is that this despair is overtly celebrated and you'll find yourself intrigued with how the game invites you into the cyclical trap of hope and despair exactly as it says it will.

SUMMARY

I really can't recommend this game enough.  There's a bit of 'made for PSP' to the edges of the game world but like most things it's overcome with tremendous style and a real passion behind the project.  You'll be ""watching"" more than ""playing"" but the strength of the storytelling is paramount here and the gameplay flows with and (more importantly) reinforces the storytelling.  There are precious few games that are like this, you need to play it to truly understand.

Needless to say I'm a fan of the series. The story in 5 was really fun, I don't want to spoil it at all but I really liked the cult uprising story they went with for this one. If you've played the previous Far Cry games and liked them, this one is a must. If you're not familiar with the series I'd still highly recommend this one. But if you want to get a feel for it before investing in this one you can usually get Far Cry 3 on sale for pretty cheap and the story in that one is equally as fun in my opinion.

17011488,Frostpunk,41937727,"[h1] DISCLAIMER: This is a full review, and NOT a first impressions review [/h1]

Frostpunk is a game developed and published by 11 bit Studios, the same people behind the amazing This War of Mine

The story follows a group of people moving from the ice cold winters of London and move onwards to seek new ventures elsewhere. You are the Captain or the leader building tents, infirmaries, plantations and such whilst also making tough decisions that may make or break the city

Frostpunk is more like an interactive story with the skin of a city builder - just like This War of Mine, which is also an interactive story told through a surival game. So, if you want to experience stories of people struggling under very harsh circumstances with challenging resource management gameplay and a great soundtrack, then this game is definitely for you!

That said, Frostpunk has some core city builder elements, that's why people have such a huge misconception and endless city building mode is under great demand by players

People who are a survival games' lover will feel like playing a really atmospheric game with some city building elements is your thing, Frostpunk will definitely be your cup of tea

If you love the idea of making hard choices through signing new laws and looking for a game with simply gorgeous graphics and like the idea of surviving, overcoming and adopting challenges and obstacles, Frsotpunk is definitely the game for you

However, you should expect a long game. First, the main scenarios, which are currently three in total, can be finished in dozens of hours, depending on your skill and the difficulty you are playing on and you should really think that this game is all about morale choices

If you're looking for a game with a sandbox mode such as Cities: Skylines or SimCity, then don't expect anything at the present time, however, I really hope they will add it soon, because at the current time, it looks a bit dull and incomplete with only three short scenarios, with adding a sandbox mode it would be an amazing tool to spend some time in such a game

Frostpunk is amazingly created and is a wonderful game from the creative developers of This War of Mine and if you liked that game, then Frostpunk is definitely for you!

[*]I tried being a completionist by seeking every relic/document. Becomes too much of a grind as these artifacts are littered everywhere.
[*]Linear. Very few places have an option to just run around and explore. Mostly you will be blocked by air-walls if you try to be adventurous.

[u]What could have been better[/u]
This game is not bad by itself, its just nothing new compared to previous installment. Previous version (2013) was a big deal because it was huge difference from its precurors in terms of graphics and gameplay. I think a possible step forward is to have a more open world like Skyrim or Witcher. I have played both these games and after that, I find it boring to just keep going in the only path forward. Once you get hang of the controls, it is not too challenging to manuever your way around either. 
Another improvement can be in melee combat. I can just keep hitting toughest of enemies with my fully upgraded pickaxe and they can't do anything. Instead, options to perform a variety of martial art moves + AI's ability to block may make close combat interesting.",1528704201,1528704345,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197992627271,35,7,1735,0,1735

Wonderful gameplay, fast-flowing action, a bunch of wacky characters to match wits against and enough challenges to keep you busy for quite a while. Oh, and you get to play as Batman of course.
The game consists of Joker taking over Arkham Asylum and Batman having to stop him, battling inmates, rescuing guards and sneaking around taking down thugs in the most Batman ways possible.

Just as the Dark Knight Trilogy defined Batman on film, the Arkham series defined Batman in games, setting a standard to which all future superhero games should aspire to.

Sad to say, I can no longer recommend this game. It was awesome when I tried it for the first time, though during it's updates it's gotten worse. Now you can't get far without geting killed by players due to the pvp. If they had non-pvp that'd be much better for those just looking to have fun in the wild, without getting killed by players that has advanced further then a guy with a rock. There is sadly no option to play singleplayer either, unless you make your own server, but that seems like a lot of effort just for a singleplayer option.

You may or may not disagree/agree with my review, but that's fair enough. It's just my thoughts on it, and maybe others too.

8099733,Assassin's Creed Odyssey,69917509,"Assassin's Creed is a great game for quarantine. The world is enormous, richly detailed, and filled with a decent cast of well voiced characters. But the game feels like a solid core with a trashy coat of paint on the marble. Visit a city, any city, in this game, and immediately historical sites flash up with little notes about this or that location. But the game opens with a speech and a character lifted wholesale from 300 by Frank Miller. A Spartan (a society 80% slaves/helots) rants about freedom while they stand alone at the Hot Gates. The same applies to the battles. The game brags of 300+ soldier conflicts, but they don't resemble an actual war fitting the conflict we're set in. instead it's a brawl, something that Thucydides himself would have called out for being wrong. Where are the phalanxes? The formations that felled Persia? Nowhere to be seen. 

Similarly, start a conversation, and it's clear this is a Fallout 4 situation, where all the lines really point to more or less the same answer. After 32 hours of play I can count one decision with a ""consequence"" and as the ""tips"" screen reminds me constantly, I can always save scum to test the outcomes. Ubisoft paid close attention to the Witcher:Wild Hunt, but did not understand how dialogue and character can layer on alternate meanings and growth. The result feels pointless and padded.

And padding might have something to do with the uPlay store the game reminds you of in quiet ways. If uPlay is online (and it sure tries to be) the spammed ""challenges"" ""achievements"" and invitations to get some special currency feel obnoxious. Playing a single player game, I really don't need to see people's screenshots on the map. Or missions, with at least one racist title slipping right past any censor. But somehow the game keeps finding a way to remind me of all I'm missing if I'd just pay a little more. It's annoying.

Then there's the core loop itself. The world's big, but it's rare to find an option other than ""go here, kill that, come back"". There's little creativity in the design. Instead it's soon clear this is another Ubisoft game, one of ""bases"" and ""territory"", a model that feels copied over again from the Division, or Far Cry, or whatever else the company puts out these days. Assassin's Creed: Odyssey may be my favorite of that type, but it's still a Ubisoft game these days.

19868149,Conan Exiles,43927373,"I  think this game may be the buggiest game I've ever played. That's not an exaggeration. The other thing, the combat is so bad. The hit notifications dont' exist. The range of moves also don't exist. It's really bad. The PVE content in the game is also a waste of time. The so-called ""dungeons"" and that kind of thing are super boring, unrewarding, buggy, and ultimately pointless. 

The scenery is pretty. The building is OK but when you log in to find half of your base missing do to a spawning bug that never gets repaired by the devs - that's super frustrating. And it will most likely happen to you. 

Overall, the game looks pretty and it has great potential but judging by how the devs focus on adding new content instead of fixing the foundation I don't think the game will ever be complete. They need to fix the foundation. Make the lore and the PVE interesting. Fix the combat. Deal with all of the gamebreaking bugs. That kind of thing needs to be the focus and not the addition of hundreds of new building pieces which will also be subject to bugs.

324594,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,41309868,"A fantastic game, but not the flawless masterpiece some claim.

To start off, I will say that the greatest strength of this game is the story and characters. The plot is consistently compelling and is filled with a variety of fleshed out characters. 

The gameplay is where some problems arise. The combat itself isn't bad by any means but it also pales in comparison to some other ARPG's.  There isn't a lot of weight to the fighting and, despite having a good amount of customization, the combat ends up feeling quite simple and repetitive.

More than the combat however, I believe of one of the games largest issues is the incredibly repetitive mission structure. Its not a exaggeration to say that the vast majority of quests boil down to using your witcher senses to follow a trail, finding your objective, then engaging in combat.  The plot is usually enough to keep you pushing forward but there is a definite lack of variety in objectives. 

There is also some issues that arise from the open world nature of the game. The plot from the beginning is to find your adopted daughter as fast as possible yet you will stop constantly to take on simple contracts and to run errands because the open world needs to be fleshed out. This ruins the sense of urgency the main plot tries to convey.

Despite this, the open world is actually very impressive. Visually, in sound design and content. This does not feel like the typical Ubisoft-esque open world where you head from tower to tower unlocking new content. Finding new areas and quests feels natural.

Overall, it is no doubt a great game but I feel many people overlook the flaws due to the quality of the story, and CDPR's quality business practices (which should be commended). 

Overall a solid 8/10 and certainly the best in the series so far. I hope to see them fix the mistakes in Cyberpunk 2077.",1522978874,1523122555,True,0,0,0,True,False,76561197988951585,166,11,8396,0,7088

You have to go in knowing that the game is only 1-2 days away from being 3 weeks old and that it is very early access. Expect wipes and expect bugs. Knowing that however, it is still a really fun game and one of the better early access games I've played.

I have heard people compare aspects of this to both Rust and Ark, and while I never played Rust, there is alot of things players will find that resembles Ark but so far it's launch is superior in every way than when Ark launched.

Combat is a bit dull and repetitive at times and could use some work

Construction has some tweaks to go but it is still decently done

You will get lag spikes and some stuttering

Overall it is a good game. Anyone giving this a bad review has not put enough effort into it or has just had a bad experience on the wrong server. The game is far from finished, and again, it is very early in the early access stage. Funcom only has 30-35 people that work for them so they are doing a good job being as active as they can with a limited team so for that I commend them.

There is lots to come from this game and a ton of stuff they have talked about that will greatly improve the game as it grows and expands.

Then get your face splattered in the next room.   Which makes killing everything in that room all that much more fun.

The weapons are awesome, and have a healthy feeling of the originals, while still feeling new, effective, and awesome.   iD has also added in several upgrade systems, from suit upgrades to help you switch weapons faster or find secret areas easier (not too easy, mind you.), to weapon addons (charged stun shot on the Plasma Gun, for example).
Each weapon I've come across, sans two, have 2 addons available, and if you unlock both of them, you can switch between them in battle.

Also harkening back to the old days, you no longer reload.  All your ammunition is available to your gun at all times.

But just the sheer brutality of the melee kills you can do, from curb stomping an Imp, to ripping a soldier's arm off to bash him in the head with it, in the middle of a huge firefight, at that!  Chaining back and forth from fighting to brutalizing enemies.

And I'll end it off with this..... an Imp sprinting sideways in front of you, suddenly jumping up and spinning sideways to fling a fireball at you.  Absolutely awesome designing.

First of all, in my almost 30 hours of Gameplay, most of the time I am playing as a Survivor. So this a Survivor-only point of view type of review.

FIRST PART OF REVIEW (LONG VERSION)*
*TL;DR version on the bottom of this review

This game shines in the first time you play it. Great atmosphere, the ambient sound effects add to the suspense. Also, you never know what to expect, since at first there are four (five now) types of killers, each with their unique skills.

Now, when you get the hang of it, it would seem a little bit repetitive, since it has only one goal: Escape from wherever you are by powering-up two metal doors using Five generators scattered throughout the map. There are different types of maps, although it WILL feel the same as you play along.

The thing that keeps me from playing this is by unlocking various skills as your chosen Survivor character levels up, called perks - which can greatly increase your chance of survival.

The only bad thing that I am greatly annoyed at this game is its awful matchmaking. It's tedious. Especially when you're in groups. And also, no in-game chat, which is understandable, since it would make it easy for survivors to reunite if ever there was an in-game chat.

Overall, a mediocre multiplayer horror-survival game that has its fair share of intense moments. Much greater when you play with friends. 


SECOND PART OF REVIEW (TL;DR VERSION)

PROS
+ Enjoyable early-game
+ Best when played with friends
+ Has its fair share of intense moments
+ You can unlock skills which are beneficial to your survival
+ Ambient sounds add up to the suspense
+ Environment is creepy-ish, adds to the suspense, but not Silent Hill level


CONS
- Repetitive
- Bad matchmaking system
- Has only ONE game mode
- Not-so-much enjoyable when playing alone
- Laggy host means laggy game. Should have dedicated servers

12595585,Mark of the Ninja,23120403,"When a game like MARK OF THE NINJA comes around I have a hard time truly enjoying it. The game should be the 2D side-scroller masterpiece that everyone talks about whenever the stealth genre is mentioned, but it's so insecure that thinking about it again makes me sad of what could've been.

As a stealth game MARK OF THE NINJA is wholeheartedly dedicated to it in its mechanics, low health, poor visibility by the player character, indication of being spotted and other standards of the genre compliment a dynamic movement system where the player can climb on walls and ceilings, helped with a grappling hook, that makes movement an absolute joy. A plan that goes awry can quickly become an impressive half-improvised ballet, mixed with an overall beautiful art style and overall design, makes the game's flow impressive. Getting there, however, requires a massive amount of getting used to on PC where the keyboard and mouse is certainly not the preferred.

This system is supposed to encourage replayability, with larger levels towards the end of the game seemingly allowing the player to choose their own path. Yet this dangerous gambit fails where replaying shows how rigid the game is, a tense and exciting section becomes bogged down with a mechanical, repetitive, predictable challenges which destroys any investment. Compated tighter level in the beginning, the later levels leads to turbulence.

There's also an upgrade system with various gadgets that can be used defensively or offensively, keeping a freshness to the game. Upgrade points are earned by finding certain items, or by completing level-specific challenges, or by gaining points which are determined by whether the player kills or if they are even spotted. In addition there are several outfits in the game which have certain criteria about how they works, for example one creates no noise while running but only offensive weapons can be used. 

Choices like this are encouraged by the level design, but as discussed freedom in MARK OF THE NINJA is merely an illusion to impress. The forever-tutorial by introducing new gadgets contributes to a complete flat-lining in difficulty and in interest. Combined with the later, larger levels makes the game seem like it didn't feel like it was good enough to hold interest with just the base gameplay. More levels with a actual choices or having tigther level design, or no upgrade system would've helped. The middling result leads the upgrade system seeming tacked on. This most greatly exmplified by upgrading system that rewards points for not killing, yet those upgrades are mostly offensive.

Yet the story may just be the worst part of the game, totally uninteresting and something is an after thought. The pen-ultimate cut-scene in the fianl level provides quite an interesting idea but overall an overall impression of the story is that it may as well not exist.

Overall, MARK OF THE NINJA is a game I'd cautiously recommend with a warning that you may feel somewhat unstatisfied.

What first got me to like this game was how well made it was, how smooth and polished it was on the tutorial and later open word was, then there was the attention to detail, after I found myself watching 15minutes of real-time watching ingame telivision, yeah... I was kind of impressed. =]

Gun play to me seemed very well made, practical compared to the previous two games I played, not including Vice City as that was on a PSP, not fair to compare.

I won't mention the story for obvious spoiler, all I'll say is so far I'm enjoying it.

As with all open world games, I love the various ways to do things, whether meaningless or story based. At the moment, saving up for a sniper to see if I can snipe my way through missions.

My rig is a budget AMD build, 8350 + 270x and it plays 40-50 on ""high"" (not the highest which is ""very high"")
Had some troubles adjusting settings, even making them fully ""normal"" or ""off"" (lowest possible) and started hitting 30-40FPS on those, fixed when I used ""recommended settings"" so not sure what's up with that...

17169893,Fallout 4,56880601,"Played and beat Fallout 4 on PS4 Pro 2-3 years ago. I love the Fallout series. My favorite in the series is 3 closely followed by New Vegas. Fallout 4 is different to 3/New Vegas imo. It's more of an open world exploration shooter with lots of rpg mechanics and stats/perks. You can build your char in many ways and there is tons of abilities and gear to outfit yourself with. Even tho its not like 3/New Vegas imo it's still a really fun game to hop in and play for a few hours in your spare time. Exploring the world of Fallout 4 is tons of fun solo or with your companions. The settlement building mechanic is totally optional but alot of fun to tinker around with for me. I got Fallout 4 GotY Edition for 12 dollars. That includes all the dlc. Far Harbor which I thought was awesome. For that price I decided to play through it again on PC. Max settings and 72 fps definitely beats the way it run on my PS4 Pro. I have a 144hz monitor but for some reason it caps at 72 fps. It must have some built in 1/2 refresh rate is all I can gather. Either way maxed out it stays pinged right at 72 fps and for a Bethesda game looks and runs good to me.

13381619,Grand Theft Auto V,44603732,"Usually I dont do reviews on Steam about games... but Rockstars greed and Rockstars support impotence made me unstoppable to not throw out my feelings... so...

I remember first time GTA V was announced to PC.. I was excited as huge GTA franchise fan! Intrigued that finaly I would not need to dream about PlayStation to play one of best games ever! That was huge... pricy, but huge, loved it anyway - ordered a pre-order with some huge bonuses here in Steam for quite a lot for that time for game! Enjoyed!

First I enjoyed game really much... liked it, loved it, played it a lot... but real life took my attention and GTA V and especially GTA V Online hours reduced till I was legit to say Im not playing it anymore... so few weeks before I write this review I returned and was suprised that there is a lot things to upgrade, purchase and amazing new content - even got new friends, since my old friends was not playing GTA V anymore! Started to understand that it will take few weeks to get some of my mostly desired content... that meant playing MC stuff, selling bunker stuff, researching bunker stuff, playing heists and everything... since my cars was so slow and not top notch (couldnt afford compatable for racing). So far so good ? Yeah... I always was aginst cheating - public looby modders always f**k things up.. bomb you remotely, engage PvP with god mode or etc... simply hated it - till I found community to play with and who usually occupies public lobby and kicks anyone who is just cheating or creating cage around you!

Perfect! My return will be easier in such community - I will need few less weeks to get desired items - some members are rich and lets test me newest cars (my best was Zentorno and Osiris, T20 too) but there wooow Buggati Chiron like car and it cost millions! So community players see that I cannot afford even security on my MC businesses and in some heists they put me in clear advantage since they gave double digit millions in account (I usually didnt have more than 1.5 million in-game cash) and put my reward for heist ridicilusly high (75%)... nice good heist time evenings and luckly selling some bunker stuff and woilaa - got 3.7 millions in-game cash - tought about what to buy and since it was late evening - went to sleep with idea that tomorrow I will choose what of desired content I will buy :) Got really excited about community and game again - fully returning to play it...

Sounds too good ? Yes... today (its evening of the day I wanted to choose what to buy) I recieve email that Ive been bad boy by violationg Terms of Service/EULA and I got suspended for 30 days and all my items will be deleted...

Devasted ? At beginning not really - even tought: ""Phe, Ive have done nothing bad, didnt cheat - whatever. It must be error and usually that kind of stuff is repaired and all will be fine""... Ive been heard that there is ban waves where innocent people been banned and tought that Rockstar should be fixing that - so with good willing - made ticket in Rockstar Support about my suspension and warning to delete all achievments Ive been earned so far (some of them, for example my first supercar - Zentorno, more than few years old). Guess what ? They auto-close this kind of ticket... Okay, thought thats a bug - so I got live chat with support and explained what halppened... and first line of support just say he cant help me - there is some factor that is reason for banning me and when asked about what - he was not able to say, just that its violation of ToS/EULA! As experienced customer support guy - I understand first line guys problem and tell - okay - please escalate issue about bug to his supervisor if he really cant help... so amazingly my live chat with support is taken to other guy which is less coming to me back and just closes conversation with same text ""I will not tell why you got banned, its not without reason"". Im shocked... even angry! I paid at that time 60€ for game... 

Devasted! Support should not be so bad but then I started reading reviews and internet about everything and I see a lot complains about banning innocent players, yet I remember how was going in random public lobby - if not blown appart, then caged with some modder... and then me - who hard work in-game cash to get desired car... and now this - my GTA V Online character will be deleted, all my cars will be deleted...

How I feel about it ? Im devasted,,, paid for game and I will be honest - Online part of game is last that Im in there for, since single player I have been 100% completed on XBOX360... and now they take me from me without reason or because their ban bot is failure or mistaken or simply badly coded... I keep asking why Rockstar is doing this ? My only guess would be that 60€ I have paid to them (ofc steam takse some part, so tehnicly a bit less) is not enough or they want more... You would ask how I become to this illuminati theory ? Just keeped asking why ? Ofc I have another steam accounts and by CS:GO items (played that game for more thousands of hours) I can sell - I can easaly earn those 20€ and not be bitch about all unfairness of Rockstar here, but Im man with principles and I can publicy tell - NO. Rockstar, I will not pay you more to get content I already paid for long time ago overpriced amount of €.

What to do next ? Sue Rockstar ? Nah... I readed ToS/EULA and terms I have checked checkbox that I agree and it basicly removes any rights to me to go to court to say that Rockstar is simply abusing me... Forget ? No, Im man of principle. Wait 30 days and start from zero - probably... at this point thats only thing I have left and apparently I will return to game, but probably It will take for me more than 30 days for that - just because my anger about unfair situation is too big but I still love this game, yet I understand that developer company and support is softly saying BAD.

At this point Im really glad that I never bought any shark cards and I will never buy extra copy of GTA V on other accounts to pay extra to Rockstar! Over and dissapointed!",1536259639,1575147654,False,343,29,25,False,False,76561198026964297,82,1,59069,155,54084
3609707,20XX,22555907,"This game is so sleek and fun and polished, and it's still only in Early Access! 20XX is extremely fun, whether you're by yourself or whether you're playing with a pal. Also the platforming and controls are so smooth and actually play just as good, if not better, than a certain platformer series that this game may or may not be based off of COUGH Mega Man X COUGH. 

The items and armor upgrades are all cool and unique, and it feels so rewarding when you earn them, whether it's through completing battle challenges, or platforming challenges. 20XX is also a roguelike, meaning it changes every time you play, and you get to choose which boss to take on next. New weapons also give new fun ways to use the character, allowing you to develop your own strategies to clear enemies and finish the stage. This game honestly has me more hyped than Mighty No. 9 ever could get me, and the soundtrack for this game is absolutely beautiful, and just SCREAMS Mega Man X. I actually need to listen to the full title theme before I start the game and exit the game. All the time.

Another feature that adds even more replayability are the leaderboards and daily/weekly challenges, which are premade 20XX runs, and they're solid, clean fun. The game also has a casual mode which increases accessibility to people who aren't hardcore platformer players, and lets everyone have a good time.

i play bethesda ""rpgs"" for their [b]simulation of another world how engrossing[/b] they can be. No other openworld can even hold a candle to the masterpieces that are Tamriel and the wasteland. Despite popular opinion, I found the world of New Vegas extremely dull as most of the map is an orange desert that you spend 10 minutes walking around just to get to 2 minutes of the good and actually compelling stuff. Some of the ""settlements"" in New Vegas are completely lifeless and boring. For example, Freeside, Westside, Primm(except for the Casino), and even the Strip itself to and extent are so empty and desolate. Don't tell me that the system limitations are the reason why they couldn't render more characters into the towns because even in Fallout 3 they achieved making Megaton and Rivet City riveting and seem lived in... Don't tell me that New Vegas is trying to create a certain atmosphere because I understand the atmosphere they are trying to achieve in one where you feel the hollowness and melancholy of the wasteland, but that [b]does not[/b] create for an authentic and genuine experience of being in the wasteland. Derelict zones like Freeside or Westeside should be flowing with vagrants, not just empty streets with a child or two running around. The point I am trying to make is that the post-nuclear Boston map that Bethesda has created is one of the most exciting and rich worlds to explore in a video game. This game may have less side quests than NV but each one is longer and feel so much more sincere, varied, and overall more fun than NV(partly due to the tedious and dull exploration in NV).


TLDR: As a simulation of another world, this game is perfect. If you strictly play RPGs for being able to tinker with every point or perk in your character and having them act in a way you would, you won't love this game. For those who would like exploring perhaps one of the most well crafted and rich worlds in a video game, you will love this game.

Not recommended.

EDIT: Steam fixed the issue of it not showing as owned by me. HOWEVER...

I still don't recommend this game. I only play it because my friends play it. 

I have only had very poor experiences in dealing with Zenimax support. When I played on Xbox, they GAVE MY GUILD TO SOMEONE ELSE, who I had previously removed from the guild for being an awful person to basically everyone. they got invited back by another guild member when I was on vacation, and Zenimax just gave them the guild when they asked for it. 

I contacted support, and they refused to do anything about it. I even showed proof that they were being super anti semitic and that I was the rightful owner of the guild, and they still did nothing. 

In short: If you want to play a game where the company who runs it doesn't give a single fuck about you, and only cares how much money you can shit into their mouth (they have microtransactions that cost upwards of $150 in premium currency and like 8 basically required ""DLCs"" that cost more than $20 each), go ahead and buy this shit-tier game.

[u] The Definitive Skyrim Review [/u]

[h1] Oh No You Didn't [/h1]

Oh no, you did not just go to the reviews. You know you're playing Skyrim, everyone's playing Skyrim, Pope's playin' Skyrim. Your mom is playing, she has a level 12 Argonian, it's not built well, but back off, she's having fun. Don't be a sitting-in-the-reviews-like-you-dont-know-what's-what-type-of you very well know what Skyrim is.

It's fun until you get bored and see the failings in it, which is after hundreds of hours for players new to RPGs or fantasy, and after dozens for long time stat sheet builders. Then you're gonna get some mods and play it for way longer. Outta here with that ""Ima check the reviews"" nonsense. Get yourself a stealth archer and start gimping this one dungeon sim.

[h1] Cons [/h1]

Combat is weak. 
Love hurts.
House building DLC isn't worth it.
Bugs are frequent.
Companions will block narrow passageways, making you swear at dinner.
Many builds underpowered at high levels in unmodded Skyrim.
Suffers in general from the scaled levels vs leveled zones debate.
Without mods, new playthroughs require a decent amount of main missions to get important ability to ground dragons.
[i] She [/i] kissed  [i] me [/i], how was [i] I [/i] being unrealistic?
Crashes are frequent.

[h1] Don't Miss Out [/h1]

Game benefits from mods that patch bugs, fix UI etc. Don't wait on these types of mods, use them on your 1st playthrough, I wish I had them when I played the console version half a decade ago. It was clearly a romantic moment, there was nothing ambiguous about it.

[h1] Get Outta Here [/h1]

Stop reading about it. Go in blind. Fall in. Go play this before getting bogged down with spoilers or tips or a compulsion to ""win""  instead of experiencing it or an article about how Fallout 3 is actually awful and although you laugh it off the analysis haunts you and years later you realize how shallow it really is despite the hundreds of hours you played it thinking otherwise, and then you realize that love is so fickle that it probably isn't real if it can be entirely nonsensical so soon after being so clear.  I just don't see why she pretends it didn't happen we had never both been so happy, but maybe that's the lesson, just stay rational, get money, like, rate, and subscribe thanks for 500k, you guys my grandmother's boyfriend's hilarious Fail Vines now have their own merch shops YOU WERE THE ONE THING I WAS SURE WAS REAL.",1482975379,1482998559,True,0,1,0,True,False,76561198026766738,110,9,24554,0,14041

16378977,ARK: Survival Evolved,74772898,"While I do recommend giving this game a try if you are a masochist I will say that I really wish the devs game the combat an overhaul.

Currently the game revolves around taking 10 guys to a dino, trapping it in a man made cage/wall/fence and then shooting it with tranq arrows/darts until after 100's of shots it finally falls asleep, then it takes hours to feed it and wake it up tamed in your tribes name.

I don't like that.

Two solutions, the first would not require many changes, they would just have to make the game more balanced around solo/duo torpor/damage/resistances and attack/movement speeds. I would recommend they look at some videos of Darkfall / Darkfall Unholy Wars for Inspirations on proper PVE and PVP Gameplay.

Route 2 would be an overhaul of the combat system to work more like Darksouls so that each monster has a move set so you can dodge/block/parry/do some move to counter the moves of the dinos, they can add some randomness to it when it comes to the choice of move the dino does but since there are hundreds of dinos remembering which moveset to dodge each dino will bring a level of mastery to the game easy to learn difficult to master, instead  of its current meta of difficult to learn, very difficult to master.

Old comments v

Hey All so i have played for 20 hours, I have not had anywhere near as many issues as some people.
Not once have i had problems with hte game loading and whatever else issues etc quests bugging and so on

Bless is like most MMos it doesnt bring anything new, it isn't trying to bring anything new, I have enjoyed  my time so far, dungeons are fun, the first two are  meant to be completed by ones self or max of two.

Crafting is enjoyible, leveling and playing with hte pet system is pretty fun. 

Now i have to add that i recommend changing some settings in the .ini files, this will help alot. so what the game it's self doesn't do it,  the fact is you can resolve these small issues your self.

Yes there are some language issues, but i wouldnt consider it a deal breaker

Honestly give the game a try, find a guild join in on the fun and have a good time!! if not watch the game and watch the devs.. come back in a month or so.",1527762915,1539605225,False,0,0,6,True,True,76561198028213959,1076,8,4324,0,4046

I was getting party wiped after the 3rd or 4th mission on the second to easiest level (veteran). The command room has bad events happening constantly as well. I get that some gamers like for a game to kick them and enjoy suffering. I don't, so how about actually giving me an easy difficulty instead of starting at overwhelming and moving up from there? I dialed it down to rookie and the next mission I a had battle of 4 vs 17 enemies, the vast majority of which had 1) more health, 2) more firepower, 3) more power.

Also, the load times for missions are absurd. Seems like I am sitting there for a minute or 2 loading and another minute or 2 when done.

21260686,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,47791174,"After nearly a month of slogging through questing content from Realm Reborn and Heavensward (this is 9 days away from my ""free"" subscription expiring, the one you get from purchasing the base game), I can say that this style of MMO gameplay is not for me at all, not just for the tab-targeting combat system but for other reasons. For one, the questing is required in order to get up to current content; that's every single one of the main scenario quests unless you want to pay to skip the first arc. For two, each quest has from one to two cutscenes to skip, complete with load screens and inane dialog I care nothing about. There are also unskippable cutscenes which are mercifully few, but after several days of trying to charge through all the content like this, I reached a point where I just could not stand it anymore.

I liked the systems at play: the crafting was serviceable, the challenging combat for most dungeon and trial bosses was satisfying to learn, and the variety of classes to choose from and learn how to play properly were everything I could ask for being an alt-oholic. I just can't stand the rest. The questing is dull, and that takes up over 70% of the game's content without much available to mitigate it. You can't out level the main scenario and ignore it, and that's what broke me. The main scenario content overstays its welcome immensely, and you need to do it in order to unlock dungeons of higher difficulty. That is what I cannot stand, and they sync you to lower levels for some of these quests, even if you're not going to be in a group to do it. So, you can't speed through all of it while over leveled. You can't outright ignore the quests, either.

I'd rather be grinding dungeons with fascinating mechanics to practice and triumph over than sitting through dialog I always skip, cutscenes which I treat much the same, and intermediate, instanced encounters which don't involve other players or interesting game mechanics in the least. All these are required to progress to the content which my friends want me to try, the raids and dungeons for the current expansion. There may have been ways for me to ignore most of this inane content to get to the current stuff, but those ways involve me paying real money to avoid gameplay that should've been enticing... should've been. That gameplay didn't interest me at all.

To make matters worse, at the end of both Realm Reborn and Heavensward's main content arcs there was a slew of old quests after the credits meant to ""tide people over"" until the next expansion came out. Yes, there are credit rolls in this MMO for each expansion arc, but one can skip them, too. All those quests should've been made optional for those coming to play later on and who just want to grind up to the level cap with dungeons, but no, they're all required, all part of this game's main scenario. Eventually, I began to dread the do-nothing progress of ""talk to this person,"" and I used to play World of Warcraft several years ago. Now you know why I no longer play WoW and will no longer play this game.

This was my first and only Final Fantasy MMO, and I have to say that the story-telling tropes found in the recent single-player installments are also in this game, much to this game's detriment or benefit depending on who you ask. The story isn't always enticing to those who play games, to those who play MMOs especially. Mostly, the story should be optional in an MMO setting. The motivations for which I fight monsters and even gods aren't to see the struggle of common, fictional folk and to bring those struggles to a head or even a triumph. No. I fight them for the challenge of it, and the interesting methods used in circumventing that challenge only sweeten my experience. No stories need to apply to my gaming experiences, and I needn't be punished for skipping those stories by a black load screen. Every. Single. Time. I want to skip a scene.

When I cannot get to the next pressing challenge without talking to several hundred NPCs I care nothing about (skipping their cutscenes, their dialog, their fictional problems), that's when I lose interest. It may be a Final Fantasy game, and their line has always been one for stories told through the ages and at great lengths. But I cannot play an MMO which puts hollow stories in my face, requires me to at least give them a glance, and tells me to do that several hundred times over just to get to the far more challenging content I'd rather see. In World of Warcraft, I could ignore the quests which I was over-leveled for (at least up to the point where I needed them for faction notoriety), but the main scenario quests in this game can't be ignored (without extra charge) if one wants to engage in dungeon or trial content at higher levels.

This is where I stop, at level 61, just past Heavensward's main arc, looking at Alpinaud's dumb face for the twentieth time, in between the supposed ""end"" of Heavensward and the start of Stormblood, after having sat through the in-between quests from Realm Reborn to Heavensward without being moved by their stories, and not giving a damn what any of these fictional people have to say or want me to do. If the previous sentence came off as plodding and inane, that was the intention. Plodding and inane are two words I'm summing up this game with. A story shouldn't be the main content of any game, it should enhance it, and I tried to listen to this story at first. Only thing is, I lost interest right after the boat to La Noscea (the start of my character's journey). The story couldn't hook me at the start, so why should I care? And if I don't care, why should I be forced to skip through the rest of the story scene by scene?

I shouldn't have to pay a dime more just to skip a story arc, either. That's supposed to be a wealth of content to experience and enjoy. I'd be robbing myself. The bulk of this game's content was a disappointment to me, and one cannot escape most of it without paying extra. I got past the point where I could've paid to skip, but there was more pointless content waiting for me. To any who like or love this game, I wish you luck, but my journey stops here, never to continue willingly or without complaints. It's a traditional MMO in every sense, but it's one with traditional RPG story-telling that doesn't belong.",1545692205,1545692205,False,7,3,0,True,False,76561198010867995,101,9,7874,0,7394

Pros: 
*Lots of fun when you ramp up the challenge. 
*Intuitive, simple gameplay with different character classes that have different key perks. 
*Never the same cave twice (procedurally generated). 
*Minerals in games are shared - there's no kill-whoring in the Borderlands style of Co-op.
*Cel-shaded graphics look gorgeous to me. Game can be played on low spec PC which makes it more accessible.
*Drop in multiplayer gameplay makes joining a game midway very easy - if you have a group of friends, it makes sure no one gets left out.
*Upgradeable equipment, perk trees and mission objectives in game.
*Enemies are quite diverse and interesting to kill.
*Game is still under construction. I've had this game for 7 days and they've already added updates twice.
*No bloody microtransactions! Vanity Store uses in-game mined gold.

Cons:
*Needs an overarching story or some overall mission structure to prolong interest. Still enjoying this now, but I think maybe a campaign or a way to upgrade your base over time would will keep players involved.",1531087063,1531087063,True,0,0,0,True,True,76561197973159013,505,11,9240,0,600

2621570,Cold Waters,33156662,"What I wanted from this was a vague representation of the realities of a Cold War gone Hot. A chance to see what it would be like if the technically superior US / UK boats had to go up against their generally inferior USSR counterparts. Sneaking up on your Russian enemies using your quieter boat, tagging them with your suprerior Sonar systems and then being able to decide if shooting and giving your position away is worthwhile or holding fire for a better chance.

This is not this game. To put it in simple terms every encounter comes down to shoot them before they shoot you. The concept of running silent, running deep, deciding to keep at all quiet and hope the bad guy gets in to a good position to shoot at or risk it all and run the course before dropping to all quiet and sitting like a 'hole in the water' does not exist at all in this game.

It's clear that the game is meant to be a game version of Hunt For Red October because the in game engine, display and controls give plenty of opportunity for launch counter measures and tanks blow let's put her on the roof gameplay but once the novelty has worn off you see what a shallow gameplay mechanic it is.

The encounters all revolve around assign a fire solution and kill them before they detect you, if they detect you then go full last half hour of Hunt For Red October and hope the five torpedos the enemies have launched at you miss. The only issue is the game has mission in it that actually force you to use stealth, that force you in to waters where you simply cannot recreate those action packed scenes from Hunt For The Red October and when you're crawling along at 1/3 with 'all quiet' and then enemy is showing no signs of seeing you and then all of a sudden they open up with their rocket propelled depth charges and hit your EXACT location to within an 8th of an inch, the illusion that this game is anything more than an arcade sub driving action game is lost.

Oh don't get me wrong it can be tense and it can be fun but it only works when you are in the correct parts of the map doing the correct missions. Those are fleet hunts in deep waters. Any mission that requires work that involves real stealth or takes part in shallow water and you are going to have a bad day and worse still the game does not allow you to pick the location. Once an engagement starts you are forced to engage, now if the situation didn't work in my favour I could at least sit on the bottom and use time accelerate, then quit out once the enemy has moved on, but the enemy doesn't move on, they seem to know you are there and they will hunt and in most cases find you (yup even sitting on the bottom, all quiet with no engines running) and kill you. You are forced to engage. You can if you're lucky go deep, turn away from the enemy and then run at full steam and hope you can get clear, only problem you then leave the engagement drop back to the world map only to then get immediatly put back in to the engagement map with the same enemies you just ran from.

The game looks great, the gameplay is simple but can be fun and tense, but only in the right mission types but it isquiet a long way from being a simulation.",1499034883,1499034883,False,16,0,0,True,False,76561197990782730,177,9,2171,0,1128

Is it fun and worth the price?
It is very enjoyable if you're into this kind of puzzle game. It gets challenging later on and requires you to rethink your strategy from girl to girl.

Whats with the sounds and Visuals?
It is nice to look at and the voices are decend to good. I would say one of the best I've seen for this type of game.

Have you encountered any bugs while Playing?
Not a single one yet.

Would you recommend it?
It is a less complex game of Bejeweled and gives you nudes as reward. Nice visuals and sounds. 
I would definitly recommend it.

WOW.

I can't remember the last time a 2d game thrilled and challenged me this much, it's almost overwhelming.  The game is a masterpiece.  It has everything thing.   Beautiful art, music, sounds, gameplay, style, value, variety and fun.  I have to say the challenge is so amazingly well ramped from the easy breasy start to the heart racing white knuckle hard-mode boss fights SO many games get that wrong and this game nails it.  The death mechanic is brilliant, when you die a dark vessel comes out of you.  Then you must return to your death point from a save point and defeat the vessel!  It's so good!

Basically if you like modern games in the 2-d metroid/castlevania style (like axiom verge) get this game immediately.  
If you like dark souls and wish there was something similar but in 2-d.  Get this game.
If you're a ""premium games only"" gamer, this is one of those premium top notch games.  Get it.

There are just a few issues with the game that you may encounter - it should not stop you from buying the game if you're interested but I have to disclose them to be fair.

-You really need a controller.   I used a xbox 360 wireless controller and it was fantastic.
-The game is quite large, and even though there's some fast travel options backtracking and looking for secrets/extras can be really time consuming.
-There are a few parts of the game that were for me just insanely hard - BUT They are almost ALL OPTIONAL.  So, if you want the hard ending put on your dark souls hat and get ready to die and retry, or look up some tips if you get frustated because you're going to get pushed.  However just getting the regular ending provides a fair challenge without the frustration so you can always take that route first and then go back if you really want to do the hard stuff.

I'm so happy I played this game and I look forward to future games by the developer Team Cherry.

This will not stop modders in online, but a better anticheat could. I still see modders in 4/10 of the sessions I join.

This was to force people who want to expierence the DLC content to play Online instead of spawning the new vehicles into single-player. Too bad the new vehicles are all outrageously expensive to purchase if you don't want to spend several days farming. This encourages people to buy shark cards of course, but I don't understand how Take Two is disappointed that consumers aren't paying for these microtransactions. Are the hundreds of millions you have already made not enough?

10673209,Satisfactory,76750868,"This game is listed at $30 and is in beta right now, but make no mistake, if development ceased tomorrow, I would be willing to pay upwards of $45 for the content already here. This is not just a good game, this is a great game. Bottom line: this is the most satisfying factory game you will ever play. If you liked infinifactory or factorio this will blow your socks off. I'm serious.

Visual design: 10/10. This game has two complimentary aesthetics: the lush green of nature, and the cold gray of steel. Neither one screams out above the other. The nature is beautiful and the machines are also beautiful. There's no environmental message about how one is better than the other or whatever. There are just two very good aesthetics which play off of each other well. And none of it takes itself too seriously either. The natural landscapes are full of weird twisty cliffs and alien mushroom dealies, the machines all have a splash of color and the conveyor belts like to do that dr seuss twisty thing where they just sorta snake around wherever. It's FUN.

Sound design: 9/10. Good ambient music that gets out of the way and lets you relax, basically does everything right that the minecraft soundtrack did right, but with even better sound effects. Which brings us to...

Animations: 9/10. The animations and the sound effects play off each other really nicely, so I had to talk about them at the same time. You place conveyors by pointing your magitech construction gun at point ""A"" and point ""B"", and the conveyor draws itself along the full length with a satisfying ""woosh"" sound. You point your construction tool where you want a platform, you see a little holograph showing where it will place, then you click to confirm and it lands with a nice heavy CLUNK sound and animation. You load your crossbow/nailgun thingy and there is this incredibly satisfying KA-THUNK as you pull back the spring. Everything works, everything feels heavy and satisfying and fun to use.

World: 10/10. The world is reminiscent of minecraft, but with way more fidelity -- but I'm pretty sure it's not actually procedurally generated at all? I don't remember where I read this, but I'm pretty sure everything in the world was put there intentionally, and man does it show. There are nice open plains for the early explorer to set up shop, there are hostile biomes full of armored or fire-spitting alien critters, there are ore nodes placed in weird ""how the heck am I supposed to drive my tractor there"" locations, and there are cute platforming parkour challenges that are 100% optional because you could just pillar your way to the goal but trust me it's way more fun to jump around like mario if the odyssey power moons were replaced with giant space slugs.

Factory: 9/10. Ore spots don't run out, so once you get something automated it stays automated, which is nice. If you accidentally overproduce, you can chuck the excess production in a recycler which gives you coupons for aesthetic items, which is also nice. Conveyor belts are a little wonky since they like to connect in curvy lines rather than conforming to a boring grid, but working around the funky belt shapes keeps things interesting. After that, its basically the machines from factorio -- this one smelts ore, that one crafts simple recipes, that other one crafts complicated recipes, you know the drill. One notable change from the factorio formula is that, rather than ""fuel-burning"" and ""electric"" versions of machines, all machines are already electric but you start with a primitive generator that has to be fed manually. It serves the same design purpose but it makes it a lot easier to upgrade your factories later when you just have to swap out one power cable instead of having to check every machine.

Overall: 10/10. I don't think I have ever seen a factory game this polished nor will I ever see one again. The devs have put so much love into absolutely every corner of this game's experience. If you have ever played a zachtronics game or have fond memories of factory mods for minecraft or, hell, if you enjoy breath of the wild or fallout new vegas but thought they needed a few more metric tons of whimsical conveyor belts, then please do yourself a favor and set aside a weekend or two for Satisfactory.

I played my first 100 hours on official servers #1001, #1010 and #942. I have experienced my share of hackers and people who exploit constantly and I slowly watched those servers die because of it. I decided to move to a slightly modded server which at the time was 3x loot respawn. Becoming an active admin on the server after about a week, the game changed drastically in my eyes. A good clean enviroment free of abuse/hackers/exploiters made a world of difference. Now I spend my days banning players who are using exploits or hacks, to preserve the integerity of the server.

Some takeaways:
-The graphics, mud, and some other things are overwhelmingly shiny, it looks unrealistic. There are some graphical errors every now and again 
-NPCs and others sometimes pop out of walls, jump over things or do behaviors that don't make much sense.
-The AI Director has a tendency to do some wacky things on the missions. 
-General bugs.

Not only does this isometric RPG measure up to many modern third person AAA's, I would argue that it surpasses them.

Who did that?"" 

The soundtrack of DOS2 is no joke, either; anyone would know that when the game prompts you to select a [b] leading instrument [/b] in the soundtrack during character creation. I personally prefer the Bansuri versions of many of the tracks, but all of the variants sound wonderful, all orchestrally with a divine flair (heh) that I didn't know I needed in my life until now.

This game isn't just looks and sounds, however; the turn-based RPG archetype has always been one of my favorite genres in the gaming scene, and DOS2 blew all of my expectations out of the water. With 10 different schools of skills and magic (11 if you count source-specific skills like Bless) with over 200 individual abilities, ~45 different talents (including racials), and entirely scripted encounters to push you to your limits, this game's combat system is pretty damn GREAT. With four (or two if you play Lone Wolf, like me) characters to customize, the sheer amount of flexibility the game offers is wonderful to experiment and toy with. All of this works in tandem with the storyline, where the tags mechanic and ability checks keep story scenes active in the player's experience, where a failed check might require you to find another way around an obstacle, or a successful check roping you into something you never expected. DOS2 loves to keep you on your toes with every interaction, every fight, every turn. And damn, if it wasn't a thrill.

19862853,Conan Exiles,49500897,"I can recommend this game at least for the singleplayer/coop part.
Great graphics (although propper hardware is required), good sound, great soundtrack, not many crashes while my playtrough. What makes it even greater: when playing with ingame voicechat, your char ist moving his lips (more or less) accordingly. 
Fighting was okay, felt absolutely in love with the unique katana slash. No magic like in age of conan, but at least some finishers were gory enough. 
The building part can be a pain in the barbarian behind. You'll ask yourself a lot of questions like: why is this surface occupied? Why can't I put one brick onto another, whats the system behind the structures?
But lorewhise and the way the devs filled the world with life, I was quite happy.

All in all I had a really fun time, but still wish for a modern age of conan and it's glorious brutal finishers",1552312406,1552312406,True,0,0,0,False,False,76561197994876565,507,59,8936,0,8431

20099223,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,26264288,"Am I received it for free? Yeah, because I've already paid for Skyrim back in the days. So it's not ""for free"". On the other hand, Bethesda made it much more fairplay, than in so many other HD remakes - like Sleeping Dogs HD case, for instance.

Basically, it's the same Skyrim people know and love about 5 years already, with DX11 visual enhancements, which were optional before. All achievements are the same, and yet you need to open them again - which some of crazy achievement hunters might even like! Sadly, something is bugged with achievements, though, some are getting them, some (like me) - are not. And we're all playing the same thing, with the same basic installments!

Tell you what I'll do. I'll reinstall the vanilla. It runs smoother, it has mods - and do not punish you for using them, like the ""new"" game. It's just have much more options, than this remake! I've played ""Special Edition"" for more than 5 hours, and I didn't noticed anything really new around. It's all the way the same Skyrim! So why torture my PC with newer tech specs I was never cared about? I'm good with what I had already.

So far, day 1 release product notes: Skyrim is still a great game. A wonderful adventure for hundreds hours (days) of playtime. New visual effects are making some background... but I never played games for visual enhancements. May the Crytek and all other graphical freaks go and love themselves! I cherish the games for the fun, and not for hi-res flowers and hi-res blood on them. So far... fun is all on the side of vanilla version.
